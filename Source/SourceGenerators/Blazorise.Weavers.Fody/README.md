## Fody

The naming conventions `Blazorise.Weavers` (bw) and `Blazorise.Weavers.Fody` (bwf) are necessary.
Similarly, the `ModuleWeaver` class in `bwf` follows Fody's required naming convention.

### Purpose of `bw` and `bwf`

- **`Blazorise.Weavers` (bw)**:
    - Exists solely to create a NuGet package (includes `Fody.Packaging` which does exactly that).
    - Created NuGet package is necessary for Fody to work. It works under the hood and is created on build.
    - It acts as a wrapper for `bwf`.

- **`Blazorise.Weavers.Fody` (bwf)**:
    - The actual implementation of the weaving logic.
    - This is the "real hero" performing the weaving tasks.

### Why `bwf` is Not Referenced Directly
The `bwf` project is not referenced directly in any other project because:
- Its purpose is to be put inside nuget package
- Fody in the `Blazorise` project automatically picks up the NuGet package for weaving. The package is created in bw proj.
- Nuget package, that is created from bw (using bwf code) is named `Blazorise.Weavers.Fody`,
exactly the same as the bwf project. And you get a lot of fun with `Ambiguous package name` errors...   

### Challenges and Solutions

Since `bwf` is not referenced:

- It is not built when you build a project like `Blazorise.csproj`.
- To address this, a custom MSBuild target was added to `bw` to explicitly run `dotnet build` on `bwf`.
   - And can be turned off with `-p:BuildBlazoriseWeaverDll=false`.
- bwf dll is there

### Current Workflow

- The DLL from `bwf` is "hardcoded" as a reference in `Blazorise` (via `WeaverFiles`). (it's taken from official docs)
- This ensures that the weaver logic is available during the build (exactly where it should be).

### Future Considerations

Creating and referencing a NuGet package for both `bwf` and `bw` would simplify integration (would remove the Weavers projects).
However - harder to make changes to the weaver (build package, change package, etc...).

## ModuleWeaver

- `ModuleWeaver.cs` removes:
  - (Always) - Usages of attributes from `Blazorise.SourceGenerator.Features`. This is done every time (the Blazorise project is built).
  - (On `IsPack==true`) Source generated files from `Blazorise.ApiDocsSourceGenerated`. This code stays inside the `Blazorise` assembly on simple build without IsPack property (for example when `Blazorise.Docs` is running).
  - (On `IsPack==true`) Reference to `Blazorise.SourceGenerator.Features`. `Blazorise.ApiDocsSourceGenerated` code uses the dtos from this assembly.
