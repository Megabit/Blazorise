This is based on the implementation of DeepCloner from https://github.com/force-net/DeepCloner
The reason why it is directly integrated into the Blazorise project is to avoid any potential issues with the original library and to have full control over the implementation.
This gives us freedom to make any changes that are necessary for the Blazorise project.

Any predecessor directives conditionals have been removed in favor of the dotnet core implementation.
Huge thanks to the original authors for their work!
