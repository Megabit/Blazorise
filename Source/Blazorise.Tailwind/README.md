## Quick guide (windows)

- [Download](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/releases) `tailwindcss-windows-x64.exe`

- Rename downloaded file to `tw` (not necessary, but makes life easier)
  - add the `tw` location to Path variable in windows as it will make it a lot easier to work with

- Open terminal in root of your project and: `tw -i .\Styles\blazorise.tailwind.scss -o .\wwwroot\blazorise.tailwind2.css --watch`
