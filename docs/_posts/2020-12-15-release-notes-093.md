## Breaking changes

### .Net 5

Blazorise is now running fully on .Net 5, and .Net Core 3.1 is not supported any more. This decision was hard but needed, mainly because of a new IComponentActivator that finally gave me a way to initialize components the way I wanted it from the start. Until now I had to do a lot of workarounds to make every component overridden for each of the supported CSS providers. While it worked for the most part, it was slow and unoptimized, meaning each component had to be created twice. Not any more. IComponentActivator gave me a way to register custom components through DI and then initialize only those components that I want. As a result Blazorise should now be a lot faster, and finally I can implement some outstanding features that were impossible until now.

## Features

### Snackbar

A lot of UX and internal improvements are done on `Snackbar` component. We added an option to delay closing of the snackbar automatically if user is clicked on a snackbar directly. First click will delay the close event and second click will close it immediately. The behavior can be controller by new `DelayCloseOnClick` and `DelayCloseOnClickInterval` parameters.

Other changes are the introduction of new `SnackbarHeader` and `SnackbarFooter` component. This will allow more freedom to make snackbar to appear as classic Toast component. This change also bring slight breaking change because from now on `SnackbarAction` must be placed inside of `SnackbarBody`, `SnackbarHeader` and `SnackbarFooter`.

`SnackbarStack` has also received some of the changes. For start, `Push` method is removed and it is replaced with new `PushAsync` method. It can now receive `message` and a `title` parameters, while other options are controlled through the `options` builder.

### Datagrid: Multiple Selection

Introduced multiple selection support for Datagrid. This was done by introducing a new enum `DataGridSelectionMode` defined by the `SelectionMode` parameter. You can now select between the default `DataGridSelectionMode.Single` or the new `DataGridSelectionMode.Multiple`.

Use the new `DataGridSelectionMode.Multiple` to enable multiple selection on Datagrid. Clicking rows will now select multiple records at a time. You can now access them by using the `SelectedRows` and also bind to the `SelectedRowsChanged` event callback. The single selection behavior is maintained, so the last clicked record will still register as the selected record provided by the `SelectedRow` parameter.

Optionally you can use the new Datagrid column `<DataGridMultiSelectColumn>` to enable a checkbox column that works exclusively with multiple selection. 
You can either use your own `MultiSelectTemplate` render fragment to customize the input that will appear in the column and trigger the multiple selection by then binding to the provided `SelectedChanged` event callback or just use the provided default by not specifying a `MultiSelectTemplate` render fragment. When using this extra column, the top row column, will provide the ability to select or unselect all rows.

An example can be found in [DataGrid]({{ "/docs/extensions/datagrid/#datagrid-multiple-selection" | relative_url }}) page section.
