There can never be any big release without some small issues. Blazorise `v0.9.4` is no exception so we bring you all the bug fixes reported since the launch day.

## Recommended steps

A lot of times we get reports regarding the JavaScript interop and having an invalid operation. Mostly the problem is because browsers tend to cache JS and CSS files and then are using an older version than the current application is expecting. The solution to the problem is easy. You just need to add a version parameter to the JS and CSS files whenever you update Blazorise, eg. `v=0.9.4.1`.

```html
<link href="_content/Blazorise/blazorise.css?v=0.9.4.1" rel="stylesheet" />
<link href="_content/Blazorise.Bootstrap/blazorise.bootstrap.css?v=0.9.4.1" rel="stylesheet" />

<script src="_content/Blazorise/blazorise.js?v=0.9.4.1"></script>
<script src="_content/Blazorise.Bootstrap/blazorise.bootstrap.js?v=0.9.4.1"></script>
```
