There's no too many changes in this patch, but there were some critical issues that needed to be handled.

- The first one is the bug on vertical `Bar` component for server-side Blazor project when renderMode is set to `RenderMode.ServerPrerendered`. We have by accident called JSInterop from `OnInitializedAsync` instead of in `OnAfterRenderAsync`.

- I have no idea how I missed this one. Apparently, `xs` breakpoint was deprecated from Bootstrap long time ago. Thanks to report from [@Remy-Be](https://github.com/Remy-Be) I realized my mistake and quickly fixed the issue.
