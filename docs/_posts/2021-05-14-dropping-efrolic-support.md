It pains me to say it but I have decided to drop support for [eFrolic](https://github.com/efrolic/css). I think this can be one of the hardest things for any developer but some things have to go sooner or later. While I would like for eFrolic to be a part of Blazorise, it really doesn't make sense anymore to support it. The author has left it a long time ago and it seems no new work will be done to improve it. All my calls have gone without response.

So I want to focus my effort on new things. Especially since the new [Bootstrap 5](https://blog.getbootstrap.com/2021/05/05/bootstrap-5/) was released just recently. Also, I think [Metro CSS](https://metroui.org.ua/) deserves a chance to be part of the Blazorise provider family. Anything is possible.

That is all for now. Stay tuned!
