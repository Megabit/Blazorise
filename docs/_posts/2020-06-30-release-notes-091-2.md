This release comes only with support for latest .Net Core 3.1.6.

Before you get it you first need to update Visual Studio and .Net Core. Running Visual Studio Installer will install everything for you, but just in case here are the latest links:

- [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) or [Visual Studio Preview](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/preview/)
- [.NET Core 3.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1)
