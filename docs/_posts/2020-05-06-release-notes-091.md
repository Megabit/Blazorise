An old Croatian saying _Ispeci pa reci_, would roughly translate _Think before you speak_. That perfectly explains what happened with Blazorise v0.9.1. Initially, I said it would take me about a month to finish it, and it's been over two months now. I guess I should be more careful with predictions in the future.

The good news is that new version is finally done, and with more features and bug fixes than it was initially planned. Thanks to the help of  many contributors.

So without further ado, let's get into what's new in this release of Blazorise.

## Breaking changes

First we need to cover breaking changes. There's not many of them but they need to be mentioned at least.

- `DataGrid` styling properties are replaced with new styling actions so it's now possible to dynamically control the row styling
  - `RowClass` and `RowStyle` replaced with `RowStyling`
  - `FilterRowClass` and `FilterRowStyle` replaced with `FilterRowStyling `
  - `GroupRowClass` and `GroupRowStyle` replaced with `GroupRowStyling`
- All properties from `DropdownMenu` moved to it's parent component `Dropdown`
- `Visibility` property replaced with new `Display` utilities
- ChartOptions `Axe` field renamed into `Axis`

## Major New Features

### Vertical Bar

Probably the biggest and most complicated change in this version is the new vertical mode for [Bar]({{ "/docs/components/bar" | relative_url }}) component. For a long time I wanted to have it, but knowing it would be really complex I just postponed it every time. 

So I finally decided to give it a go for v0.9.1. At the same time [@MitchellNZ](https://github.com/MitchellNZ), one of the community members, contacted me and asked to help me with some of the features scheduled for Bar component. In the end all the work on vertical mode and improvements for Bar component was done by him, with me only guiding and helping with final optimization regarding the theme support and other smaller issues. The amount of work he has put into it, all in his spare time, long nights and on weekends, is mind-blowing. Really I cannot thank him enough times.

Some major new features of vertical bar:

- Collapse mode
- Small icons in collapsed mode
- Popup menus
- Responsive collapse
- Theming support
- Custom breakpoints

Describing all of the features of new vertical mode would not be enough so it's best to just show it in action.

For more on how to use it, check out the updated [Bar]({{ "/docs/components/bar" | relative_url }}) documentation.

### Carousel

The new `Carousel` component was requested multiple times over [Blazorise Gitter](https://gitter.im/stsrki/Blazorise), so I guess it was only fair to finally make it. 

Initially I though it would be fairly easy, but I must admit it was harder than I anticipated. As always [AntDesign](https://ant.design/) had it's own strange logic for the carousel component, so that's one problem I had to solve. 
Another problem was support for animating slides, I didn't want to use any JavaScript so this one is still unsolved. But even in this non-animated state, I think it's ready to be used.

_So what does it have?_ It has all the basic features like looping slides, clickable indicators, previous/next buttons, and configurable loop time.

To learn more, just visit the [Carousel]({{ "/docs/components/carousel" | relative_url }}) page.

### Jumbotron

Blazorise components were always more of "admin-page" oriented. So having Carousel component already done, I figured another component for "frontend" pages wouldn't hurt. There's not much I can say about it, except that it allows you to add a **full width banner**  to your webpage, which can optionally cover the full height of the page as well.

Example of [Jumbotron]({{ "/docs/components/jumbotron" | relative_url }}) can be found in the documentation.

### TreeView

This component is actually a new extension for Blazorise done by [@robalexclark](https://github.com/robalexclark), also one of the community members. He created the TreeView component near the end of v0.9.1 development stage, just in time to make it part of the release. The component is fairly easy to use, so just go to the [TreeView]({{ "/docs/extensions/treeview" | relative_url }}) page to learn how to get started with it. 

Big thanks to Robin for making it!

### Validation

Validation components also got some new features:

- Instead of having validation message for each validated field, now it is possible to place a `<ValidationSummary>` component that will act as a placeholder for all the errors and messages raised by the `<Validations>` component. It is used in places where you don't want to break your UI with too many error messages.
- Added new `StatusChanged` that will run whenever there is change in `Validations` state.
- Now it's possible to skip auto-validation when page is loaded for the first time, and instead run it when user starts to enter form fields.

### Closable Badge

Not that big of a change but it is good to have. You can define `CloseClicked` event on [Badge]({{ "/docs/components/badge" | relative_url }}) component, and it will automatically show you the close button.

### Theming

A lot of work was put to theming support in this release. 

- Change color of vertical Bar
- Option to define Sidebar width and height
- Luminance threshold for calculating the text color contrast
- Fixed modal footer buttons for Material provider
- Options to define media breakpoints
- Default colors for AntDesign when Theme is not used

### Display utilities

Similar to `Margin` and `Padding` utilities, the new `Display` utility is also created with fluent syntax in mind. It is inspired by the Bootstrap [display](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/utilities/display/) and [flex](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/utilities/flex/) utilities, but all packed under the one `Display` utility.

Just a basic usage of new utility:

```html
<Paragraph Display="Display.None.Block.OnFullHD">
    hide on screens smaller than lg
</Paragraph>
```

## Cleaning & Optimizations

### Delete unused components

These components were leftovers from the time when Blazorise was still young. So I think it was finally time to remove them.

- `Panel`
- `Navigation`
- `NavigationItem`

### Cascading stores

While this change is only internal and not directly visible to outside world, I still think it deserves to be mention. To simplify Blazorise API and to easier work with cascaded values I come up with new _store_ objects to keep the component state. The biggest benefits of new stores are:

- The ability to cascade only one object instead of multiple smaller objects or properties.
- No need for event-handlers to notify child components of each change.
- Easier to compare if store is actually changed when used in child component.

For those of you wanting to learn more you can visit the original [PR](https://github.com/stsrki/Blazorise/pull/869).

### Chart new APIs

Sometimes when `Chart` is updated too many time in a small period of time, an exception within `chart.js` will happen. I tried to pin-point the error but the search was always pointing to `chart.Update()` when used as a separate call over `JSInterop`. So to overcome the problem I introduced some new APIs that will do the data and label update in just one call.

**Old:**

```cs
await lineChart.AddLabel( Labels );
await lineChart.AddDataSet( GetLineChartDataset() );
await lineChart.Update();
```

**New:**

```cs
await chart.AddLabelsDatasetsAndUpdate( Labels, GetLineChartDataset() );
```

## Work from Community 

I must say community around Blazorise is growing larger with every new release. And this time we have some pretty big PRs worth mentioning.

- First I would like to talk about [StefH](https://github.com/StefH). He created new `CardDeck` component and fixed some smaller issues, but his most significant work in this release is the new JSON serializer for `Chart` component(s). The built-in .Net Core and Blazor serializer was always limited in a way that it would also serialize null fields, despite having them marked as _non-emitable_, which would not work well with `chart.js`. So StefH cleverly converted all objects into `Dictionary` and the final result worked really good. From now on, using `Options` property on `Chart` will be safe and recommended way of working with charts. 

- I have already mentioned `TreeView` component done by [@robalexclark](https://github.com/robalexclark), but it doesn't hurt to mention it one more time.

- Honorable mention to [@MitchellNZ](https://github.com/MitchellNZ) and his work on Vertical Bar mode. Without your help who knows when Blazorise v0.9.1 would be released.

Big thanks to everyone that helped with Blazorise v0.9.1 coming to life. My wish was always to have active and live community around Blazorise, and after almost two years all the hard work has finally paid off. Once again, thank you!

## Closing notes

_What comes next?_ For starters I will take some free days to clear the head. After that I will start planning for the next milestone while I will also maintain and clean some bugs introduced with v0.9.1. Let's not fool our self, there are always some bugs :)

That's it for now. I hope you will like this new version and that there will not be too many problem. Enjoy, and hopefully see you soon. Cheers! 🍻
