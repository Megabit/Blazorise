  To upgrade your project to the new version you should first need to install new Blazor before installing Blazorise. To install Blazor look at the [official](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/webdev/2019/02/05/blazor-0-8-0-experimental-release-now-available/) documentation. 

  **Note:** Keep in mind that after upgrading you will only be able to work in Visual Studio 2019!
  {: .notice--info}

- Added registration method for Blazorise with an optional configuration in which it's now possible to configure some of the internal settings and behaviour.

  ```cs
  public void ConfigureServices( IServiceCollection services ) { 
    services
      .AddBlazorise( options =>
      {
        options.ChangeTextOnKeyPress = true;
      } )
      .AddBootstrapProviders()
      .AddFontAwesomeIcons();
  }
  ```
- Since `SelectEdit` and `SelectItem` are now generics there are some special rules to be followed when using them. Please look at the [Select]({{ "/docs/components/select/" | relative_url }}) page to find more.

### Enhancements

- Added new `Validation` component for input fields. [link]({{ "/docs/components/validation/" | relative_url }})
- `SelectEdit` and `SelectItem` are converted to generic components and now they supports all kinds of data types and not just strings.
- Optimized ClassMapper and fluent builders. Now they're about 50-60% percent faster when generating class names.

## 0.5.x

### Breaking Changes

- Changed how to register and use Blazorise CSS providers and icons. eg:

  ```cs
  public void ConfigureServices( IServiceCollection services ) { 
    services
      .AddBootstrapProviders()
      .AddFontAwesomeIcons();
  }

  public void Configure( IComponentsApplicationBuilder app ) {
    app
      .UseBootstrapProviders()
      .UseFontAwesomeIcons();
  }
  ```

  See the [usage page]({{ "/docs/usage/" | relative_url }}) for each provider on how to use it.
- Icons moved to a separate project and now must be installed as a Nuget package.
- `BarDropdown` is refactored to use new `BarDropdownMenu` component. This was necessary to have more control and also for bar-dropdown to have a similar structure as regular dropdown. 
- `BarDropdownToggler` renamed to `BarDropdownToggle`

### Enhancements

- Added "Empty" providers to allow using of extensions without CSS providers, see [usage]({{ "/docs/usage/#empty-provider" | relative_url }})
- Finished chart extension. [link]({{ "/docs/extensions/chart/" | relative_url }})
- `Modal` and `Dropdown` components will now be closed automatically when clicked anywhere on the page.

      <FieldBody ColumnSize="ColumnSize.Is10">
