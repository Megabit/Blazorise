## Overview

Once again the Blazor team has [released](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/aspnet/asp-net-core-updates-in-net-core-3-1-preview-3/) a new preview of .Net Core 3.1. This is just a minor update to keep Blazorise on track. All other major fixes and features will be in the next `v0.8.7`.

## Update

The update process is the same as before. You need to update your _Visual Studio to 16.4_ and also install newest _.Net Core SDK_ before you get the latest Blazorise. It's pretty straightforward and there should not be any problems. Just follow the [official guide](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/aspnet/asp-net-core-updates-in-net-core-3-1-preview-3/). After you update to the latest Visual Studio and .NET Core SDK you should be safe to get the latest Blazorise 0.8.6.4
