## Overview

Since work on **v0.9** will take some tome I will try to keep regular updates for **v0.8.8**. This update is the just the first one.

## Fixes

- [#494](https://github.com/Megabit/Blazorise/issues/494) Missing SortDirection.None
- [#496](https://github.com/Megabit/Blazorise/issues/496) InvalidOperationException: Unsupported type System.UInt64 for NumericEdit

## Closing notes

I really enjoy working on Blazorise but it's not easy with all the disturbances at home. And running private VPS servers is not cheap. So, if you like the project please donate via [Buy me a Coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/mladenmacanovic) or [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/mladenmacanovic). Or if you wish just leave a star on [GitHub](https://github.com/Megabit/Blazorise). Thanks!
