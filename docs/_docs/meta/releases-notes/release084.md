## Overview

This release is mainly focused on upgrade to the latest version of Blazor preview 9. All new features are moved to next milestone [0.8.5](https://github.com/Megabit/Blazorise/milestone/21).

### Breaking changes

- You need to update your _Visual Studio to 16.3 preview 3_ and install newest _.Net Core SDK_ before you install the latest Blazorise. Please follow [official guide](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/aspnet/asp-net-core-and-blazor-updates-in-net-core-3-0-preview-9/) before you continue. After you follow all the steps you should be safe to get the latest Blazorise 0.8.4.

- `MouseEventArgs` is renamed to `BLMouseEventArgs` to prevent naming collision with the Blazor event arguments.
