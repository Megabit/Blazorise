## Date

DatePicker is based on a [flatpickr](https://flatpickr.js.org/) datetime picker and as such is not a native date input element. That means that unlike `DateEdit` which will render `type="date"`, `DatePicker` will render `type="text"` in the DOM.

### Simple usage

```html
<DatePicker TValue="DateTime?" />
```

### Format

Native **Flatpickr** component has some special rules regarding the date format string. To make it easier to use we tried to map the flatpickr custom formatter to behave as close to `.Net` date format string. Bellow you can find the list of available and supported mappings between Blazorise and flatpickr.
