`<Link>` is the building block for most Blazorise components that offer link functionality. A `Link` component behaves like an `<a>` element, except it toggles an active CSS class based on whether its `href` matches the current URL.

## Example

By specifying a value in the `To` property, a standard link (`<a>`) element will be rendered.

```html
<Link To="user/settings">
    Link text
</Link>
```

## Anchor Links

A `#` in front of a link location specifies that the link is pointing to an anchor on a page. (Anchor meaning a specific place in the middle of your page).

Typically `<a href="#">` will cause the document to scroll to the top of page when clicked. `<Link>` addresses this by preventing the default action (scroll to top) when `To` is set to `#`. If you need scroll to top behavior, use a standard `<Link To="#">...</Link>` tag.

```html
<Link To="#foo">
    Link text
</Link>
```
