## Open Development

All work on Blazorise happens directly on GitHub. All external contributors must send pull requests which will go through the review process.

## Branch Organization

We use separate branches for development and for all new features. After all the features are done in the seperate branch it will be merged into the `master`.

Development branches follows the naming based on the milestone version number. For example if the milestone is `0.5.2` the main develop branch will be named `dev052` and all feature branches will be based on `dev052`. Feature branches follows the naming `dev052-feature-name`.

## Pull requests

When submitting a pull request:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a branch from `dev{version-num}` and give it a meaningful name (e.g. `dev{version-num}-my-awesome-new-feature`) and describe the feature or fix.
3. Open a pull request on GitHub.
