                    We license on a per-developer basis. All members of a development team using our products will need a license. We do not charge run-time, royalty, or deployment fees. For additional details on our licensing, please refer to our pricing and plan details.

                    The number of licenses purchased must correspond to the maximum number of concurrent developers contributing changes to the front-end code of projects that use Blazorise.
                </Paragraph>
                <Paragraph>
                    <Strong>Example 1.</Strong> Company A is developing an application named 'AppA'. The app needs to render 10k rows of data in a table and allow users to group, filter, and sort. The dev team adds Blazorise to the project to satisfy this requirement. 5 front-end and 10 back-end developers are working on 'AppA'. Only 1 developer is tasked with configuring and modifying the data grid. Only the front-end developers are contributing code to the front-end so Company 'A' purchases 5 licenses.
                </Paragraph>
                <Paragraph>
                    <Strong>Example 2.</Strong> A UI team at Company A creates an internal UI library that includes Blazorise as a component. Teams working on 'AppA' (5 front-end devs) and 'AppB' (3 front-end devs) use it. There are 2 front-end devs on the UI team. Company B purchases 10 licenses.

                    If freelancers use Blazorise for client projects, they are considered developers using Blazorise in their work and need a commercial license. Who purchases the license depends on the agreement between the freelancer and the client.

                    Blazorise Blocks are ready-made sections (e.g., checkout, stats, login forms) built on top of Blazorise components, so you can integrate them without designing or coding from scratch.

                <Paragraph>
                    In essence, while Blazorise provides the foundational components and tools, Blazorise Blocks offer higher-level, more specialized modules that are based on those foundational components for specific use cases.
