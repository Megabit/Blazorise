                    By ending the yearly subscription you will no longer get free Blazorise updates, access to our support web and access to our private repositories. The last Blazorise version that was at the time of ending the yearly subscription will stay with you and you can continue to use it.

                    The number of licenses purchased must correspond to the maximum number of concurrent developers contributing changes to the front-end code of projects that use Blazorise.
                </Paragraph>
                <Paragraph>
                    <Strong>Example 1.</Strong> Company 'A' is developing an application named 'AppA'. The app needs to render 10k rows of data in a table and allow users to group, filter, and sort. The dev team adds Blazorise to the project to satisfy this requirement. 5 front-end and 10 back-end developers are working on 'AppA'. Only 1 developer is tasked with configuring and modifying the data grid. Only the front-end developers are contributing code to the front-end so Company 'A' purchases 5 licenses.
                </Paragraph>
                <Paragraph>
                    <Strong>Example 2.</Strong> A UI development team at Company 'A' creates its own UI library for internal development and includes Blazorise as a component. The team working on 'AppA' uses the new library and so does the team working on 'AppB'. 'AppA' has 5 front-end developers and 'AppB' has 3. There are 2 front-end developers on the UI development team. Company 'B' purchases 10 licenses.

                    Therefore, they would need to obtain a commercial license for Blazorise. The responsibility for obtaining the necessary Blazorise licenses would depend on the terms of the agreement between the freelancer and their client company.

                    Blazorise is a component library for Blazor that provides a range of UI components and utilities to help developers build web applications more easily.
                </Paragraph>
                <Paragraph>
                     Blazorise Blocks are a set of predefined UI elements or modules built on top of the Blazorise library. These blocks simplify the web development process by offering ready-to-use sections (like checkout, stats, login forms, etc.) that developers can integrate into their projects without having to design or code them from scratch.
                </Paragraph>
                <Paragraph>
                    In essence, while Blazorise provides the foundational components and tools, Blazorise Blocks offer higher-level, more specialized modules that are based on those foundational components for specific use cases.
