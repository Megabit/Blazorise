</DocsPageSubtitle>

<DocsPageParagraph>
    For testing purposes, there is currently an internal Blazorise Service that should be configured as Transient so the bUnit test engine does not throw an error.
    You should add this setup:
    <Code>ctx.Services.AddBlazorise().Replace(ServiceDescriptor.Transient&lt;IComponentActivator, ComponentActivator&gt;());</Code>

    Other than that it should pretty much work out of the box. Let us know if you're having any difficulties.

    For some testing examples, you can look at some of our <Blazorise.Link To="https://github.com/Megabit/Blazorise/tree/master/Tests/Blazorise.Tests" Target="Target.Blank">tests</Blazorise.Link>.
    For an helper package that can be used to getting started testing of Blazorise components with bUnit, see the next section.

        We provide an helper package that can be used to getting started testing of Blazorise components with bUnit.
    </DocsPageParagraph>

    <DocsPageParagraph>
        Here's a basic usage example:
    </DocsPageParagraph>
    <DocsPageSectionSource Code="AddBlazoriseTestingExample" />

    <DocsPageParagraph>
        Both <Code>AddBlazoriseTests</Code> and <Code>AddEmptyIconProvider</Code> are provided by this package. As for the providers you can use any of the Blazorise providers.

        Due to the nature of how tests are ran in bUnit, javascript interop calls have to be mocked. We also provide ways to mock the javascript interop calls for each of the Blazorise components.
        Here's an example of how to mock the javascript interop calls for the Blazorise Button component:
