    Learn about how Blazorise components work.
</DocsPageLead>

<DocsPageParagraph>
    Many components grow to be quite complex in features. Certain combinations might have different behaviours.
</DocsPageParagraph>

<DocsPageParagraph>
    In this section, we document and specify the behaviour we've designed for the more complex components and how certain combinations are expected to work.
    Very specific behaviours that may help with corner cases our users might have found, are also documented.
