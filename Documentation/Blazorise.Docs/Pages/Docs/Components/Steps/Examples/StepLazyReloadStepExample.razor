            This Steps component is set to <code>LazyReload</code> mode, meaning that only the active tab will have it's html rendered at a time. 
            Try typing some text in the provided Text components and changing between tabs, the tab will always be refreshed as the tab content is always lazy loaded, 
            therefore re-calculated.
