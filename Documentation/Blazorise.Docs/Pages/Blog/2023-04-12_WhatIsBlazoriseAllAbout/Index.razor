    Now you might be wondering why to use Blazorise over other UI libraries...
</BlogPageSubtitle>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    Multiple CSS framework
</Heading>

<BlogPageParagraph>
    Blazorise provides developers with a comprehensive set of UI components, styles, and utilities that help them create modern, responsive, and highly customizable web applications. Blazorise is highly flexible and extensible. It works with different CSS frameworks, like <Anchor To="https://getbootstrap.com/" Title="Link to Bootstrap">Bootstrap</Anchor>, <Anchor To="https://tailwindcss.com/" Title="Link to Tailwind">Tailwind</Anchor>, or <Anchor To="https://bulma.io/" Title="Link to Bulma">Bulma</Anchor>, making it an excellent choice for developers looking to build web applications quickly and efficiently.
</BlogPageParagraph>

<BlogPageParagraph>
    With the multitude of CSS frameworks available, developers are often faced with choosing the right one for their projects. To make things easier, some projects allow developers to select multiple CSS frameworks.
</BlogPageParagraph>

<BlogPageParagraph>
    This approach can be beneficial for several reasons. First, developers can choose the framework best suits their skills and experience. Some developers may be more familiar with specific frameworks than others. Allowing them to choose from CSS frameworks can help them feel more comfortable and confident in their work. Allowing multiple CSS frameworks can also provide more flexibility and customization options. Different frameworks may have different strengths and weaknesses, and allowing developers to mix and match can lead to more tailored and unique designs.

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    Simple Syntax
</Heading>

<BlogPageParagraph>
    In the context of Blazorise, simple syntax without prefixes means that the framework's syntax does not require a prefix before each element, such as <Code>LibButton</Code>, commonly used in other frameworks.
</BlogPageParagraph>

<BlogPageParagraph>
    This syntax approach makes the code more concise, clean, and easy to understand by avoiding unnecessary characters. The Blazorise syntax also allows for easy extension, meaning developers can customize and add their syntax and components to the framework.
</BlogPageParagraph>

<BlogPageParagraph>
    The goal of Blazorise syntax without prefixes is to be:
</BlogPageParagraph>

<BlogPageList Ordered>
    <BlogPageListItem>
        Easy to write
    </BlogPageListItem>
    <BlogPageListItem>
        Easy to read
    </BlogPageListItem>
    <BlogPageListItem>
        Extendable
    </BlogPageListItem>
</BlogPageList>

<BlogPageParagraph>
    Overall, the simplicity of the Blazorise syntax makes it an ideal choice for developers who prioritize ease of use and readability. It allows them to focus more on the functionality of their code rather than spending time writing complicated syntax.
</BlogPageParagraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    Blazorise uses utilities instead of CSS class names
</Heading>

<BlogPageParagraph>
    Traditionally, CSS class names are used to style and customize HTML elements. Developers assign classes to elements, then use CSS rules to style them based on their assigned classes. However, this approach can be error-prone, relying on developers correctly typing the class names and remembering which classes are available for which elements.
</BlogPageParagraph>

<BlogPageParagraph>
    Blazorise addresses this issue using strongly typed utilities instead of CSS class names. Instead of assigning a class name to an element, developers use a strongly typed utility to set the element's attributes. For example, instead of using the CSS class name <Code>"btn"</Code> to style a button element, developers can use the Blazorise Button component and set its Color attribute to a strongly typed value like <Code>Color.Primary</Code> or <Code>Color.Secondary</Code>.
</BlogPageParagraph>

<BlogPageSourceBlock Code="WhatIsBlazoriseAllAbout_ButtonExample" />

<BlogPageParagraph>
    This approach has several advantages. Firstly, it is less error-prone, as developers do not need to remember or type out class names. Secondly, it is more maintainable, as changes to the available attributes can be made in a single location rather than scattered throughout the codebase. Finally, it is more expressive, as the strongly typed utilities can be easily understood and documented, making it easier for new developers to understand the code.
</BlogPageParagraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    Fluent Syntax for Chaining Rules
</Heading>

<BlogPageParagraph>
    In addition to the strongly typed utility classes, Blazorise provides a <Strong>fluent syntax</Strong> for chaining multiple rules together. This allows developers to create more complex rules for their components in a more concise and readable manner.
</BlogPageParagraph>

<BlogPageParagraph>
    For example, to define different margins for a component based on screen size, developers can use the <Code>Margin</Code> utility class and chain multiple rules together using fluent syntax. Here's an example:
</BlogPageParagraph>

<BlogPageSourceBlock Code="WhatIsBlazoriseAllAbout_FluentSyntaxExample" />

<BlogPageParagraph>
    In this example, the <Code>Margin</Code> utility class is used to set the margin of the <Code Tag>Button</Code> component. The <Code>Is2</Code> rule sets the margin to 2 on all sides by default, while the <Code>OnDesktop</Code> the rule modifies the margin to 4 on desktop-sized screens and the <Code>OnMobile</Code> the rule modifies the margin to 4 on mobile-sized screens.
</BlogPageParagraph>

<BlogPageParagraph>
    Developers can use fluent syntax and strongly typed utility classes to create more flexible and expressive components that adapt to different screen sizes and device types. This approach makes it easier to maintain and scale applications over time.

    Why would a library of UI components matter to me?
</BlogPageSubtitle>

<BlogPageParagraph>
    By utilizing pre-built components, you can speed up your coding process and spend more time developing the functionality of your application. Instead of spending hours writing code for common elements, you can focus on the more critical aspects of your project, resulting in a higher-quality end product. The development process involves writing code, problem-solving, debugging, and continuously creating new features. By incorporating libraries into your design process, you can simplify these steps and reduce the time and effort required, providing you with more time to dedicate to developing your application.
