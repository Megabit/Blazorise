## Blazorise 1.0

In March 2022, Blazorise 1.0 was released, marking a new chapter in Blazorise's history. This release resulted from hard work and preparation over the past few years. With Blazorise 1.0, we introduced many new features that made it easier for developers to build and use their applications. Additionally, we made some necessary API changes to get started with the latest version of the library.

Over the past three years, the core of Blazorise has undergone significant improvements and refactoring to enhance its maintainability, reliability, and performance. We started as an early adapter of Blazor and have kept up with all its changes, from the early previews to the latest version of .NET 6. Throughout this journey, we have had to make many refactoring and API changes to ensure that Blazorise remains up-to-date and optimized for performance.

As a result, the release of Blazorise 1.0 highlights the dedication and hard work of the Blazorise team in creating a reliable and efficient tool for developers working with Blazor. The new features and improvements are set to make the development process easier and more streamlined, marking a significant step forward in the library's evolution.

In summary, Blazorise has undergone significant improvements and rewrites in its core, making it a reliable and efficient tool for developers working with Blazor.

## The Blazorise MVC Award Program

One of the essential projects that marked 2022 is the creation of "The Blazorise MVC Award Program." Community members who took the time to report bugs and who suggested and added new features were rewarded with symbolic gifts and "crowned" with the MVC title.

Brief description of the project idea: As an open-source project, Blazorise relies on the contributions of its community members to continue to improve and add new features.

Blazorise has a thriving community of developers passionate about the project and dedicated to its improvement. These community members contribute in various ways, from submitting bug reports and feature requests to writing code and documentation.

Bug reports and feature requests are valuable contributions as they help the Blazorise team identify issues and prioritize new features. Community members who took the time to report bugs and suggested new features were rewarded with token gifts.

Writing code is perhaps the most visible and effective way community members can contribute to Blazorise. The library is open source, which means anyone can submit a pull request with changes or additions to the code. This may include bug fixes, new components, or performance improvements.

Documentation is another important way community members can contribute to Blazorise. Good documentation is essential for developers who want to use the library effectively, and it can be daunting for a small development team. Community members who take the time to write clear and concise documentation make a valuable contribution that will benefit the entire community.

Finally, community members can contribute by helping other developers in the Blazorise community. This can be by answering questions on forums or social media, creating textbooks or video guides, or simply sharing your experiences and tips for using the library.

In conclusion, the most valuable contribution of Blazorise to community members is the community itself. Whether you're reporting bugs, writing code, creating documentation, or helping others in the community, every contribution helps make Blazorise a better library for everyone. If you love Blazorise and want to make a difference, please consider getting involved in the community and contributing in any way you can. We appreciate everyone's efforts and wish to repay. Together we can make Blazorise even better.

## Blazorise 1.1

Blazorise 1.1 was released towards the end of 2022, featuring several enhancements and new features. Although there were no significant changes, the release marked the beginning of changes to the API.

The [blazorise.com](https://blazorise.com/) website underwent significant improvements, including enhanced documentation with more detailed examples and descriptions. Additionally, a search field was added to facilitate faster navigation, and more internal links were included between pages for easier access.

While the changes in version 1.1 were not groundbreaking, Blazorise is gradually changing the API. The plan is to remove APIs marked as deprecated once the project reaches a stable version of 2.0.
