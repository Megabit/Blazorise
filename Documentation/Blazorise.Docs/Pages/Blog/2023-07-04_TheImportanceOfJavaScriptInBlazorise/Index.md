# The Importance of JavaScript in Blazorise

In the world of web development, **Blazorise** has emerged as a popular component library for Blazor applications, allowing developers to build interactive web experiences using C#. Initially, the intention was to create a JavaScript-free environment. However, upon further examination and consideration, the Blazorise team recognized the value of incorporating **JavaScript** into their framework. This blog post dives deeper into the reasons behind Blazorise's decision, exploring the benefits and implications of using JS within their component library.

## Microsoft and Shift towards JavaScript

Blazorise's initial inclination towards a JavaScript-free approach was driven by the desire to create a pure C# environment, leveraging the power of Blazor's server-side and client-side capabilities. However, as the project progressed and the team delved deeper into the evolving landscape of web development, it became increasingly apparent that **JavaScript** had become an integral part of modern web applications.

JS has witnessed widespread adoption and has evolved into a universal language that enables developers to create highly **interactive** and dynamic **web** experiences. With an extensive array of JavaScript libraries and frameworks, developers can tap into a wealth of **pre-built** solutions and tools to enhance their applications' functionality and user experience.

**Blazorise** recognized JavaScript's growing importance and relevance in the web development ecosystem. They understood that by embracing JavaScript, they could harness its power and seamlessly integrate it into their component library to offer a more comprehensive solution to their users. This decision allowed Blazorise to leverage the best of both worlds - the simplicity and familiarity of **C#** with the versatility and functionality of JavaScript.

One of the critical factors that influenced Blazorise's decision to incorporate JavaScript into its component library was the endorsement and recommendation from **Microsoft**, the creators of Blazor itself. As an authoritative figure in the web development community, Microsoft's support carried significant weight and provided a strong case for integrating JavaScript within the Blazor ecosystem.

By aligning with Microsoft's guidance, **Blazorise** gained confidence in embracing JavaScript as a valuable tool to extend the capabilities of its component library. Microsoft's recommendation validated the decision to incorporate JavaScript and assured the Blazorise team that they were on the right track to provide a robust and future-proof solution for their users.

It demonstrated that JavaScript and Blazor could coexist **harmoniously**, with JavaScript complementing and enhancing the functionalities offered by Blazor. This endorsement helped dispel doubts or concerns regarding the compatibility and effectiveness of combining the two technologies.

## Careful Planning and Consideration

Blazorise's decision to include JavaScript was not taken lightly. The team embarked on a comprehensive planning phase, considering various factors and evaluating potential outcomes. They conducted **extensive research** to identify well-known and reliable JavaScript libraries that seamlessly integrate with Blazorise. This meticulous approach ensured that the chosen JavaScript libraries would work harmoniously with the existing Blazorise **codebase** and deliver a **seamless** experience for their users.

## Enhanced Functionality and User Experience

The integration of JavaScript empowers Blazorise to unlock many features and enhance its **functionality** beyond what can be achieved solely with **C#**. JavaScript libraries provide dynamic capabilities such as real-time updates, smooth animations, and advanced user interface interactions. By incorporating these features, Blazorise elevates the overall user experience, making applications more engaging and interactive. What's more important is that developers who use our Blazorise component library don't need to think about anything. It just works with JS.

## Bridging the Gap Between Technologies

Blazor's ability to bring the power of C# to web development has revolutionized how developers create interactive web applications. However, it is **essential** to acknowledge that JS remains dominant in web technologies and third-party integrations. JavaScript boasts an extensive **ecosystem** of libraries, frameworks, and tools **established** over many years.

With JavaScript integration, Blazorise empowers developers to leverage various JavaScript resources, plugins, and tools. Developers can seamlessly integrate well-established JavaScript libraries, such as charting libraries, data visualization tools, UI component libraries, and much more, into their Blazor applications. These JavaScript resources provide **ready-made solutions** for complex functionality, saving developers time and effort in reinventing the wheel.

Moreover, by **bridging** the gap between technologies, Blazorise facilitates a smoother transition for developers familiar with JavaScript. They can leverage their existing **skills** and knowledge while leveraging the benefits of Blazorise's C# and Blazor ecosystem. This **compatibility** encourages broader adoption and facilitates collaboration between developers with different skill sets, fostering a vibrant and inclusive developer community.

## Extensibility and Community Support

Incorporating JavaScript into Blazorise **brings** many **benefits**, including tapping into the vast community-driven support and resources available for JavaScript libraries. By leveraging widely adopted JS solutions, Blazorise becomes part of a larger ecosystem that opens up developer opportunities.

For example, we at Blazorise used [Flatpickr](https://github.com/flatpickr/flatpickr) using JS as a DatePicker, TimePicker component, and [autoNumeric](https://github.com/autoNumeric/autoNumeric/) in different usage scenarios like number formatting or currency formatting. This is why we **developed** seamless Blazor components for developers who don't need to think about JS compatibility with our components.

One of the significant **advantages** of joining the JavaScript community is the availability of extensive documentation, tutorials, and guides. JavaScript libraries often have well-documented APIs and **comprehensive** guides that provide **developers** with valuable insights into their usage, best practices, and advanced features. By integrating these JavaScript libraries into Blazorise, *developers* gain access to a wealth of existing knowledge, making it easier to learn and utilize the additional **functionalities** provided by these libraries.

Blazorise aligned itself with these **communities**, enabling developers to tap into a vast network of experts and enthusiasts who can provide guidance, troubleshoot issues, and share **innovative** ideas. This community support fosters the growth and continuous improvement of Blazorise by incorporating valuable **feedback** and suggestions from a diverse range of developers.

## Conclusion

Blazorise's decision to **incorporate** JavaScript into their component library was driven by **Microsoft's** recommendation, careful planning, and a focus on enhancing functionality and user experience. By embracing **JavaScript**, Blazorise expands its capabilities, bridges the gap between different technologies, and leverages the wealth of **community-driven** resources available for JavaScript. This strategic decision empowers developers to create feature-rich and interactive web applications using **Blazorise**, establishing it as one of the leading Blazor component libraries in the quick-to-evolve web development landscape.
