    Blazorise 1.8.4 – Maintenance Release
</NewsPageTitle>

<Paragraph>
    Blazorise <Strong>1.8.4</Strong> is a focused stability update. It addresses several community-reported issues to make everyday UX smoother, especially around <Strong>Autocomplete</Strong> and <Strong>Validation</Strong>, while adding small but meaningful improvements to <Strong>DataGrid</Strong>. If you're on the 1.8.x line, this release should feel like an easy drop-in with immediate quality-of-life benefits.

    What's New in 1.8.4
</NewsPageSubtitle>

<Paragraph>
    Key fixes and enhancements included in this release:
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    Autocomplete (Checkbox mode): reliable closing, no ghost overlay, correct alignment
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    We resolved a group of UI issues where the Autocomplete dropdown in <Strong>Checkbox</Strong> mode would not close on blur, could leave a “ghost” overlay on the page, or appear slightly misaligned. The control now properly respects focus transitions, cleans up overlays, and positions the dropdown consistently across themes and providers. This noticeably improves multi-select workflows and keyboard navigation.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    Autocomplete: faster, safer typing with robust cancellation
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    Rapid typing previously risked overlapping lookups and out-of-order results. We now <Strong>properly handle cancellation tokens</Strong> for in-flight operations, ensuring stale requests are cancelled promptly. The result is a more responsive feel, fewer redundant lookups, and consistent, predictable suggestion lists, no flicker, no stale data.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    ValidationRule.IsEmail: accepts valid emails again
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    The <Strong>IsEmail</Strong> validation rule was rejecting some valid addresses. We updated the logic to correctly accept common real-world formats (e.g., subdomains, “+” tags, and longer TLDs). Forms depending on email validation should now pass as expected without custom workarounds.

    Upgrading
</NewsPageSubtitle>

<Paragraph>
    This update is fully compatible within the <Strong>1.8.x</Strong> series, no breaking changes expected. We recommend upgrading to pick up the Autocomplete and validation fixes, as well as the DataGrid refinements (localization and default filter icon). If you rely on screenshot/visual diff tests, note the default filter icon change.
