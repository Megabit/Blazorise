    <Text Style="text-decoration: line-through;">Maintenance</Text> Release: Blazorise 1.1.3
</NewsPageTitle>

<Paragraph>
    This Blazorise version was supposed to be just a minor maintenance release. Instead, we got a few relatively large features and announcements.
</Paragraph>

<NewsPageSubtitle>
    .NET 7 Support
</NewsPageSubtitle>

<Paragraph>
    For a start, Blazorise now fully supports the final .NET 7 version. We believe .NET 7 is the best way to proceed with Blazor development. The number of new improvements, features, and fixes is astounding, not to mention significant performance improvements.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    To update your projects to the latest version please read the official blog from the <Link To="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-asp-net-core-in-dotnet-7/" Title="Link to DotNet blog">DotNet Blazor</Link>.

    Blazorise Templates

<Paragraph>
    We worked hard and are proud to finally bring Blazorise project templates to the Blazorise community. Our developer <Link To="https://github.com/David-Moreira" Title="Link to David">David</Link> has done a great job making it come to life. The new Blazorise Templates have support for several Blazor hosting types, WebAssembly, and Servers. It also supports the choice of .NET version, color theme, and many more.

    Blazorise Specifications
</NewsPageSubtitle>

<Paragraph>
    Last but not least. We have started a new subsection in our documentation named Specifications. The purpose of new pages is to describe in detail how our most complex components work and how they behave when supplied with different parameters. New pages for our users and ourselves will be a string reference point for components' behavior that will help us all in the long run.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    At the moment, we have only one page for Autocomplete component. The next step is covering DataGrid, our most complex component. And after that, we will regularly add new pages based on the feedback from our community.
