    New Features & Enhancements 🚀
</NewsPageSubtitle>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    Scheduler Component
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    By far, the most significant addition in this release is the <Code>Scheduler</Code> component. This powerful new component allows you to create and manage events in a calendar-like interface, making it ideal for applications that require scheduling functionality.
</Paragraph>

<NewsPageImageModal ImageSource="img/news/180/feature-scheduler.png" ImageTitle="Scheduler component" />

<Paragraph>
    Building it we wanted it to be fully built using Blazorise core elements, without any dependenices on third-party libraries, so it can be easily customized and extended to fit your specific needs. In the end we have succeeded in creating a fully functional scheduler component that is both powerful and flexible.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    As expected from such component it offers various type of views (Day, Week, Month, etc), editing features, drag-and-drop, recurring events, and more. We don't doubt that it will become a valuable addition to your Blazorise toolkit.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    You can see it in action in the <Anchor To="docs/extensions/scheduler" Title="Link to Scheduler">Scheduler documentation</Anchor> pages.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    PdfViewer Component Enhancements
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    The <Code>PdfViewer</Code> component has received several enhancements in this release, making it more powerful and user-friendly.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is4">
    PrintRequested Event
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    Thanks to community contributor from <Anchor To="https://github.com/11bthornton" Title="Link to 11bthornton">11bthornton</Anchor>, the component now supports the <Code>PrintRequested</Code> event callback, which triggers when the user requests to print the PDF document. It is a small but significant improvement that enhances the user experience.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is4">
    Download Feature
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    <Code>PdfViewer</Code> now includes built-in support for downloading the displayed PDF document. When enabled, a download button appears in the viewer toolbar, allowing users to save the PDF to their device. It supports both direct file URLs and base64-encoded data sources.
</Paragraph>

<NewsPageImageModal ImageSource="img/news/180/feature-pdf.png" ImageTitle="Pdf component" />

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is4">
    Toolbar Localization
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    The <Code>PdfViewer</Code> component is now fully localized, allowing you to customize the toolbar text based on the current culture. This is particularly useful for applications that need to support multiple languages, ensuring that the PDF viewer is accessible and user-friendly for all users.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    DataGrid Enhancements
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    As always we have made some improvements to the <Code>DataGrid</Code> component, which is one of the most popular components in Blazorise. This time we have focused on improving the batch editing capabilities, adding new features, and enhancing the overall user experience.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is4">
    The New Method Overload
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    Introduced the <Code>Task New( TItem newItem )</Code> overload method in DataGrid, enabling the programmatic addition of new items to the batch edit collection when batch editing is enabled. This method ensures that newly added items are tracked as <Strong>unsaved changes</Strong>, allowing them to be persisted upon saving or discarded upon cancellation.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is4">
    Default Select Filter
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    New parameters <Code>FilterDefaultItemText</Code>, <Code>FilterDefaultItemValue</Code>, <Code>FilterDefaultItemDisabled</Code>, and <Code>FilterDefaultItemHidden</Code> allow customizing the default item shown in filter dropdowns of <Code>DataGridSelectColumn</Code>. This gives developers more control over how filter options are presented and improves the user experience when working with dropdown filters.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is4">
    EditState for EditTemplate
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    The <Code>EditTemplate</Code> of <Code>DataGridColumn</Code> component now includes an <Code>EditState</Code> argument. This addition will allow to determine the current edit state of the row, enabling developers to customize the edit template based on whether the row is in edit mode or not. This can be useful for displaying different UI elements or providing additional functionality based on the edit state.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is4">
    Add Caption to DataGrid
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    Based upon the work on <Code>TableCaption</Code>, the <Code>DataGrid</Code> component now supports a <Code>Caption</Code> property, allowing you to add a caption to the grid. This caption can be used to provide additional context or information about the data being displayed in the grid, which is especially useful for accessibility purposes. The caption is rendered as a <code>caption</code> element, which is semantically correct and improves the overall structure of the grid.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    You can see it in action in our new <Anchor To="docs/extensions/datagrid/features/accessibility" Title="Link to DataGrid Accessibility">DataGrid Accessibility</Anchor> section.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is4">
    GroupSeparator for Numeric Columns
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    The <Code>DataGridNumericColumn</Code> component now includes a <Code>GroupSeparator</Code> parameter. This allows you to specify a custom group separator for numeric columns, enhancing the readability of large numbers by grouping digits in a more user-friendly way.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is4">
    Reordering Columns
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    The <Code>DataGrid</Code> component now supports reordering columns by dragging and dropping them. By simply enabling the <Code>Reorderable</Code> parameter on the <Code>DataGridColumn</Code>, users can rearrange columns to their preferred order. This feature enhances user experience by allowing customization of the grid layout according to user preferences.
</Paragraph>

<NewsPageImageModal ImageSource="img/news/180/feature-datagrid-reordering.png" ImageTitle="Reordering Columns" />

<Paragraph>
    On top of that, we have also added a <Code>ResetDisplayOrder</Code> method to the <Code>DataGrid</Code> component, which allows you to reset the column order to the default state. This can be useful in scenarios where you want to provide users with the option to revert any changes made to the column order.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    DatePicker Enhancements
</Heading>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is4">
    Week Numbers
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    The <Code>DatePicker</Code> component now includes a <Code>ShowWeekNumbers</Code> parameter. When enabled, the calendar displays ISO week numbers alongside each row. This can be helpful for planning or referencing by week.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is4">
    Calendar Buttons
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    The <Code>DatePicker</Code> component now includes a <Code>ShowTodayButton</Code> parameter, and a <Code>ShowClearButton</Code> parameter.

</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    Chart Enhancements
</Heading>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is4">
    Optimized Plugins Lifecycle
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    This release introduces a major optimization to the Chart plugin system by centralizing shared logic and lifecycle handling within the ChartPlugin base class. By moving common properties, initialization, and disposal routines into a unified location, the update significantly reduces duplicated code across individual plugins and simplifies their overall structure. This change also enhances how plugins are connected to BaseChart, resulting in cleaner integration and more reliable async event handling between charts and their plugins.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    The refactoring addresses longstanding pain points related to plugin lifecycle management and ensures that disposal and initialization are consistently handled. This unified approach not only improves maintainability but also helps prevent potential bugs across all plugins.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    As part of this effort, it was also noted that some plugins, such as the Streaming plugin, may require implementations of methods like <Code>OnParametersSetAsync</Code> to ensure all configuration parameters are properly updated during the component lifecycle.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is4">
    Renamed Chart Options
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    We had a wrongly named option on the <Code>DoughnutChartOptions</Code>, and <Code>PieChartOptions</Code> classes. The <Code>CutoutPercentage</Code> property has been renamed to <Code>Cutout</Code>. This change aligns with the Chart.js documentation and ensures consistency across the API. Since the field was already wrongly named, this change should not break any existing code. However, if you were using the <Code>CutoutPercentage</Code> property, you will need to update your code to use the new <Code>Cutout</Code> property.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    To make it more flexible we have also made it an <Code>object</Code> type, so you can use it as a percentage or a number. This change allows you to specify the cutout value in either pixels or as a percentage of the chart's radius, providing greater flexibility in how you configure your charts.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is4">
    Chart Zoom Plugin
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    We have introduced new set of APIs for the <Code>ChartZoom</Code> plugin. The new API are <Code>Zoomed</Code>, <Code>SetZoomLevel</Code>, and <Code>GetZoomLevel</Code>, and <Code>ResetZoomLevel</Code>. These new APIs provide a more intuitive and flexible way to manage zoom levels in your charts. The <Code>Zoomed</Code> event is triggered when the chart is zoomed, allowing you to respond to zoom changes in real-time. The <Code>SetZoomLevel</Code> method allows you to programmatically set the zoom level of the chart, while the <Code>GetZoomLevel</Code> method allows you to retrieve the current zoom level. Finally, the <Code>ResetZoomLevel</Code> method allows you to reset the zoom level of the chart to its original state.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    The <Code>ChartZoom</Code> plugin has been updated to support the latest <Code>chartjs-plugin-zoom.js</Code> version. It is recommended to update your references to use new <Code>https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chartjs-plugin-zoom@2.2.0/dist/chartjs-plugin-zoom.min.js</Code> to ensure compatibility with the latest features and bug fixes.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    Autocomplete Disabled Items
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    The <Code>Autocomplete</Code> component now supports disabling specific items in the suggestion list. You can provide a function to determine which items should be inactive, preventing users from selecting them. This is helpful in cases where some options shouldn't be available for interaction.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    RichTextEdit Enhancements
</Heading>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is4">
    Export Semantic HTML
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    The <Code>RichTextEdit</Code> component now includes an <Code>GetHtmlAsync</Code> overload that allows you to export the current content as semantic HTML. This is particularly useful for applications that require clean and structured HTML output, such as when saving or sharing content.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is4">
    Image and Video Resizing
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    We've introduced a new resizing feature for images and videos within the <Code>RichTextEdit</Code> component.

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is4">
    Multiple Highlights for Highlighter Component
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    The <Code>Highlighter</Code> component now supports highlighting multiple phrases within the same text using the new <code>HighlightedTexts</code> parameter. This enhancement allows developers to pass a list of strings to be highlighted simultaneously, replacing the previous limitation of only a single <code>HighlightedText</code>.
