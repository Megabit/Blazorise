    New Features & Enhancements 🚀
</NewsPageSubtitle>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    Scheduler Component
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    The most significant addition in this release is the <Code>Scheduler</Code> component. This powerful new component allows you to create and manage events in a calendar-like interface, making it ideal for applications that require scheduling functionality.
</Paragraph>

<NewsPageImageModal ImageSource="img/news/180/feature-scheduler.png" ImageTitle="Scheduler component" />

<Paragraph>
    We built it fully using Blazorise core elements, without any dependencies on third-party libraries, making it easy to customize and extend to fit your specific needs. In the end, we succeeded in creating a fully functional scheduler component that is both powerful and flexible.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    As expected, it offers various types of views (Day, Week, Month, etc.), editing features, drag-and-drop, recurring events, and more. We have no doubt it will become a valuable addition to your Blazorise toolkit.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    You can see it in action in the <Anchor To="docs/extensions/scheduler" Title="Link to Scheduler">Scheduler documentation</Anchor> pages.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    PdfViewer Component Enhancements
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    The <Code>PdfViewer</Code> component has received several enhancements in this release, making it more powerful and user-friendly.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is4">
    PrintRequested Event
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    Thanks to community contributor <Anchor To="https://github.com/11bthornton" Title="Link to 11bthornton">11bthornton</Anchor>, the component now supports the <Code>PrintRequested</Code> event callback, which triggers when the user requests to print the PDF document. It is a small but significant improvement that enhances the user experience.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is4">
    Download Feature
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    <Code>PdfViewer</Code> now includes built-in support for downloading the displayed PDF document. When enabled, a download button appears in the viewer toolbar, allowing users to save the PDF to their device. It supports both direct file URLs and base64-encoded data sources.
</Paragraph>

<NewsPageImageModal ImageSource="img/news/180/feature-pdf.png" ImageTitle="Pdf component" />

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is4">
    Toolbar Localization
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    The <Code>PdfViewer</Code> component is now fully localized, allowing you to customize the toolbar text based on the current culture. This is particularly useful for applications that need to support multiple languages, ensuring accessibility and usability for all users.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    DataGrid Enhancements
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    As always, we have made improvements to the <Code>DataGrid</Code> component, one of the most popular components in Blazorise. This time we focused on enhancing batch editing capabilities, adding new features, and improving the overall user experience.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is4">
    The New Method Overload
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    Introduced the <Code>Task New( TItem newItem )</Code> overload method, enabling the programmatic addition of new items to the batch edit collection when batch editing is enabled. This ensures that newly added items are tracked as <Strong>unsaved changes</Strong>, allowing them to be persisted upon saving or discarded upon cancellation.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is4">
    Default Select Filter
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    New parameters <Code>FilterDefaultItemText</Code>, <Code>FilterDefaultItemValue</Code>, <Code>FilterDefaultItemDisabled</Code>, and <Code>FilterDefaultItemHidden</Code> allow customizing the default item shown in filter dropdowns of <Code>DataGridSelectColumn</Code>. This gives developers more control over filter presentation and improves user experience when working with dropdown filters.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is4">
    EditState for EditTemplate
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    The <Code>EditTemplate</Code> of <Code>DataGridColumn</Code> now includes an <Code>EditState</Code> argument. This allows you to determine the current edit state of the row, enabling customization of the template based on whether the row is in edit mode or not.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is4">
    Add Caption to DataGrid
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    Based on our work with <Code>TableCaption</Code>, the <Code>DataGrid</Code> now supports a <Code>Caption</Code> property. This can be used to provide additional context about the displayed data, which is especially useful for accessibility. The caption is rendered as a <code>caption</code> element, improving the grid's semantic structure.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    You can see it in action in our new <Anchor To="docs/extensions/datagrid/features/accessibility" Title="Link to DataGrid Accessibility">DataGrid Accessibility</Anchor> section.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is4">
    GroupSeparator for Numeric Columns
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    The <Code>DataGridNumericColumn</Code> component now includes a <Code>GroupSeparator</Code> parameter. This allows you to specify a custom group separator for numeric columns, enhancing the readability of large numbers by grouping digits in a more user-friendly way.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is4">
    Reordering Columns
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    The <Code>DataGrid</Code> component now supports reordering columns by dragging and dropping them. By simply enabling the <Code>Reorderable</Code> parameter on the <Code>DataGridColumn</Code>, users can rearrange columns to their preferred order. This feature enhances user experience by allowing customization of the grid layout according to user preferences.
</Paragraph>

<NewsPageImageModal ImageSource="img/news/180/feature-datagrid-reordering.png" ImageTitle="Reordering Columns" />

<Paragraph>
    On top of that, we have also added a <Code>ResetDisplayOrder</Code> method to the <Code>DataGrid</Code> component, which allows you to reset the column order to the default state. This can be useful in scenarios where you want to provide users with the option to revert any changes made to the column order.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    DatePicker Enhancements
</Heading>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is4">
    Week Numbers
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    The <Code>DatePicker</Code> component now includes a <Code>ShowWeekNumbers</Code> parameter. When enabled, the calendar displays ISO week numbers alongside each row. This can be helpful for planning or referencing by week.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is4">
    Calendar Buttons
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    The <Code>DatePicker</Code> component now includes a <Code>ShowTodayButton</Code> parameter, and a <Code>ShowClearButton</Code> parameter. When enabled, these buttons appear on the calendar, allowing users to quickly select the current date or clear the selected date, respectively. This enhances usability and provides a more intuitive experience for users interacting with the date picker.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    Chart Enhancements
</Heading>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is4">
    Optimized Plugins Lifecycle
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    This release introduces a major optimization to the Chart plugin system by centralizing shared logic and lifecycle handling within the ChartPlugin base class. By moving common properties, initialization, and disposal routines into a unified location, the update significantly reduces duplicated code across individual plugins and simplifies their overall structure. This change also enhances how plugins are connected to BaseChart, resulting in cleaner integration and more reliable async event handling between charts and their plugins.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    The refactoring addresses longstanding pain points related to plugin lifecycle management and ensures that disposal and initialization are consistently handled. This unified approach not only improves maintainability but also helps prevent potential bugs across all plugins.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    As part of this effort, it was also noted that some plugins, such as the Streaming plugin, may require implementations of methods like <Code>OnParametersSetAsync</Code> to ensure all configuration parameters are properly updated during the component lifecycle.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is4">
    Renamed Chart Options
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    We had a wrongly named option on the <Code>DoughnutChartOptions</Code>, and <Code>PieChartOptions</Code> classes. The <Code>CutoutPercentage</Code> property has been renamed to <Code>Cutout</Code>. This change aligns with the Chart.js documentation and ensures consistency across the API. Since the field was already wrongly named, this change should not break any existing code. However, if you were using the <Code>CutoutPercentage</Code> property, you will need to update your code to use the new <Code>Cutout</Code> property.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    To make it more flexible we have also made it an <Code>object</Code> type, so you can use it as a percentage or a number. This change allows you to specify the cutout value in either pixels or as a percentage of the chart's radius, providing greater flexibility in how you configure your charts.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is4">
    Chart Zoom Plugin
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    We have introduced new set of APIs for the <Code>ChartZoom</Code> plugin. The new API are <Code>Zoomed</Code>, <Code>SetZoomLevel</Code>, and <Code>GetZoomLevel</Code>, and <Code>ResetZoomLevel</Code>. These new APIs provide a more intuitive and flexible way to manage zoom levels in your charts. The <Code>Zoomed</Code> event is triggered when the chart is zoomed, allowing you to respond to zoom changes in real-time. The <Code>SetZoomLevel</Code> method allows you to programmatically set the zoom level of the chart, while the <Code>GetZoomLevel</Code> method allows you to retrieve the current zoom level. Finally, the <Code>ResetZoomLevel</Code> method allows you to reset the zoom level of the chart to its original state.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    The <Code>ChartZoom</Code> plugin has been updated to support the latest <Code>chartjs-plugin-zoom.js</Code> version. It is recommended to update your references to use new <Code>https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chartjs-plugin-zoom@2.2.0/dist/chartjs-plugin-zoom.min.js</Code> to ensure compatibility with the latest features and bug fixes.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    Autocomplete Disabled Items
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    The <Code>Autocomplete</Code> component now supports disabling specific items in the suggestion list. You can provide a function to determine which items should be inactive, preventing users from selecting them. This is helpful in cases where some options shouldn't be available for interaction.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    RichTextEdit Enhancements
</Heading>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is4">
    Export Semantic HTML
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    The <Code>RichTextEdit</Code> component now includes an <Code>GetHtmlAsync</Code> overload that allows you to export the current content as semantic HTML. This is particularly useful for applications that require clean and structured HTML output, such as when saving or sharing content.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is4">
    Image and Video Resizing
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    We've introduced a new resizing feature for images and videos within the <Code>RichTextEdit</Code> component. Users can now directly resize multimedia content within the editor, enhancing flexibility and providing a smoother editing experience. This functionality can be conveniently enabled or disabled via the <Code>UseResize</Code> parameter, allowing easy customization to meet your project's specific needs.
</Paragraph>

    Table Caption
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    The <Code>Table</Code> component now has a <Code>TableCaption</Code> child component, allowing you to add a caption to the table.

The <Code>caption</Code> element is usually used for accesibility purposes, and it is recommended to use it when the table contains a lot of data or when the table is complex.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is4">
    Flex Basis Utilities

<Paragraph>
    We have introduced a new new <Code>Flex.Basis</Code> utiities that will help more easily set the flex-basis property in your app without the need to write custom CSS. The new utilities are <Code>Flex.Basis.Auto</Code>, <Code>Flex.Basis.Full</Code>, and <Code>Flex.Basis.Is0</Code>.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is4">
    Multiple Highlights for Highlighter Component
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    The <Code>Highlighter</Code> component now supports highlighting multiple phrases within the same text using the new <code>HighlightedTexts</code> parameter. This enhancement allows developers to pass a list of strings to be highlighted simultaneously, replacing the previous limitation of only a single <code>HighlightedText</code>. The update enables more dynamic and flexible highlighting scenarios, such as multi-word search, filtering, and complex keyword matching, all with minimal changes to existing implementations.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is4">
    Choices on MessageService

    The <Code>ITextLocalizer</Code> interface now includes overloads for the <Code>GetString</Code> method that accept a <Code>CultureInfo</Code> parameter. The <Code>CultureInfo</Code> parameter can be used to specify the desired culture for localization, enabling you to retrieve strings that are tailored to the user's language and region. This is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to support multiple languages or regions within your application.

    Steps Lazy Loading
</Heading>
