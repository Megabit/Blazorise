    Maintenance release: Blazorise 1.7.1
</NewsPageTitle>

<Paragraph>
    We're excited to announce the maintenance release of Blazorise 1.7.1! This release includes several bug fixes, enhancements, and updates to improve your development experience and streamline our documentation process.

    What's New in 1.7.1
</NewsPageSubtitle>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    Support for Components Without a Parameterless Constructor
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    Previously, components in Blazor typically required a parameterless constructor due to limitations in the way the framework initializes and instantiates components. With this update, Blazorise now supports scenarios where components rely on constructors with parameters, enabling advanced use cases such as Dependency Injection.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    Documentation Improvements
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    In this release, we've updated all references to static files, such as stylesheets and scripts, to include query versioning. This change improves caching behavior and ensures that the correct versions of static assets are always loaded in your applications.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    This improvement is particularly beneficial for production environments where browser caching can lead to unexpected behavior when static files are updated. With query versioning, you get the peace of mind that your app always uses the right resources.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    Automated API Documentation
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    We've introduced automation for generating and maintaining Blazorise API documentation, a significant step toward ensuring developers always have access to the most accurate and up-to-date information.

                <Strong>Comprehensive Coverage</Strong> By integrating automation, we've expanded the API documentation to include edge cases, advanced configurations, and lesser-known methods or parameters that were previously undocumented.

<Paragraph>
    The new automated system leverages Blazorise's metadata and code annotations to create robust API documentation that integrates seamlessly into the existing docs platform. This ensures that as the framework evolves, developers can rely on trustworthy and comprehensive documentation.
