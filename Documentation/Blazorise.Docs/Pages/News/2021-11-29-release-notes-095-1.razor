    Hello, again!
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    In this release, we bring you some very important fixes for the v0.9.5 that we received from the community. One of the major issues we got was
    the bug with the newly introduced JS modules, where some nasty null exceptions would occur in rare cases. I must admit it was hard to track and reproduce
    but we managed to fix it. <Anchor To="https://github.com/David-Moreira" Title="David Moreira">David</Anchor> help on tracking the real problem and helping
    with testing was the most valuable.

    Not to mention, other reported issues are also fixed and you can see them all below.
