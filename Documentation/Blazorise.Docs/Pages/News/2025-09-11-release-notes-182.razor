    Blazorise 1.8.2 – Maintenance Release (with extras!)
</NewsPageTitle>

<Paragraph>
    Blazorise 1.8.2 is now available! While this is primarily a maintenance release, we decided to go a bit further than usual: alongside targeted fixes, we shipped several <Strong>critical improvements</Strong> and a couple of <Strong>new APIs</Strong> to immediately benefit real-world apps. This isn't something we typically do in a patch release, but we felt these updates were stable, safe, and genuinely useful-so you can take advantage of them right away.

    What's New in 1.8.2
</NewsPageSubtitle>

<Paragraph>
    Here are the most notable additions and improvements:
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    FluentUI Dark Theme
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    Added a <Strong>dark theme</Strong> for FluentUI, including tuned color tokens for comfortable contrast and consistent styling across components.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    The dark palette covers surfaces, typography, and accent tokens so core components (DataGrid, Modal, Sidebar, Dropdown, Button, Tabs, etc.) look consistent out of the box. It also respects your existing light/dark toggling approach, so if you already switch color schemes at the app level, FluentUI will follow suit.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    RichTextEdit Plug-in Registration Control
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    Only register additional plug-ins if explicitly specified in options-giving you finer control over payload and behavior.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    DatePicker Initial Time Values
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    Added the ability to set the <Strong>initial hour</Strong> and <Strong>minute</Strong> values, making time-sensitive scenarios easier out of the box.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    The initial time is applied when the control first renders (or when it's cleared), helping users jump straight to the intended time instead of scrolling from midnight. This is especially helpful for scheduling apps, calendar inputs, and any workflow where a common start time (e.g., 09:00) is expected.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    DataGrid Numeric Filtering Fix
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    Numeric columns now default to <Strong>equals</Strong> instead of <Strong>contains</Strong> when filtering. This matches user expectations and avoids false positives (for example, filtering for <Code>10</Code> will no longer match <Code>210</Code>).
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    Blazorise Outlook Clone
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    We've also been experimenting with <Strong>Blazorise FluentUI</Strong> by building a small <Strong>Outlook clone</Strong>. It's a fun demo that shows how far you can go with the Blazorise FluentUI provider-layout, navigation, and productivity UX all in one place.
