<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    NumericPicker Step Issue
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    A bug was identified in the <Strong>NumericPicker</Strong> component, where using the up and down arrow keys caused the value to increment or decrement by 2 instead of the expected single-step behavior. This bug has been resolved, and the component now functions correctly, stepping by the correct increment value as intended.

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    DatePicker Incorrect Days and Weeks
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    Users experienced a bug in the <Strong>DatePicker</Strong> component where incorrect days and weeks were displayed. This issue was causing confusion in selecting dates.

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    Field and RadioGroup Buttons Issue
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    In Blazorise 1.6.1, an issue was identified affecting the layout and functionality of <Strong>Field</Strong> and <Strong>RadioGroup</Strong> buttons, specifically when using horizontal Field mode. The flex display was not functioning correctly, resulting in inconsistent alignment and interaction of these components. This bug has been resolved, ensuring that the <Strong>Field</Strong> and <Strong>RadioGroup</Strong> buttons now render and display properly in horizontal mode, with the flex layout working as intended. This fix enhances both the visual consistency and user interaction, providing a more reliable and responsive interface.
