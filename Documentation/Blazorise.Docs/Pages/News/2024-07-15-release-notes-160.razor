    Video update
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    We have updated our Video extension component to work with the new <Anchor To="https://www.vidstack.io/">VidStack</Anchor> library. Previously, we were utilizing the Plyr library for our video playback needs. However, over time, Plyr has gradually been supplanted by the newer and more advanced VidStack library.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    The decision to transition to VidStack was driven by several compelling reasons. First and foremost, VidStack offers a host of new features that were not available in Plyr. These features enhance the overall user experience by providing more robust and versatile functionality. Additionally, VidStack is significantly more stable, which means fewer bugs and crashes, leading to a smoother and more reliable performance.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    Moreover, the VidStack library is designed with modern web development practices in mind, making it easier to integrate and maintain. It supports the latest web technologies and standards, ensuring that our video extension component remains up-to-date and compatible with future advancements.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    Given these advantages, we felt it was essential to update our component to take full advantage of what VidStack has to offer. Our team has worked diligently to implement these new features and ensure that the transition from Plyr to VidStack is as seamless as possible for our users. We are confident that this update will provide a superior video playback experience and look forward to the benefits it will bring.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    In addition to leveraging the core improvements of VidStack, we have also added a few small but impactful features to our component:
