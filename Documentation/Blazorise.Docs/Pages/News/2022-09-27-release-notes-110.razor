    Announcing Blazorise 1.1
</NewsPageTitle>

<Paragraph>
    It took us way too long, but finally, after six months of hard work, Blazorise 1.1 is out and comes packed with features and quality-of-life improvements!
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    So, what happened at that time? To start, we have made a lot of improvements on <Strong>blazorise.com</Strong>. For example, we have improved documentation to include more examples and descriptions. Also, we added a search field for much faster navigation and more internal links between pages.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    One of the most significant changes is that we have finally introduced new <Anchor To="blog">blog pages</Anchor> where we regularly write about C#, Blazor and .NET. Not to mention how-to guides and tutorials where you can learn more about Blazorise.
</Paragraph>

<hr />

<Paragraph>
    There are no breaking changes in this release, but we will slowly start with some API changes by making existing APIs obsolete and introducing new APIs as replacements. Once we reach stable <Strong>v2.0</Strong>, the APIs marked with obsolete will eventually be removed.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    Internal changes are hard to showcase, but if you are curious to learn a bit more, we have documented all changes in <Anchor To="https://github.com/Megabit/Blazorise/issues/3575">1.1 ticket on GitHub</Anchor>. Also, don't forget to look at <Anchor To="https://github.com/Megabit/Blazorise/issues/3540">1.0.x fixes</Anchor>, which are also included in this release.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    <Strong>
        Blazorise 1.1 is compatible with Blazorise 1.0.x projects and is a recommended upgrade for all 1.0.x users.

    2. Tuple Values
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    Due to a bug in Visual Studio razor tooling you might experience problems if you try to define tuple values as a component parameter. In Blazorise case, this problem might manifest itself on the <Anchor To="docs/components/grid">Row component</Anchor>. For example if you have <Code Tag>Row Gutter="(32, 16)"</Code> you will get build errors. To workaround it we have introduced new parameters, named <Code>HorizontalGutter</Code>, and <Code>VerticalGutter</Code>.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    To use them you will just need to define it as <Code Tag>Row HorizontalGutter="32" VerticalGutter="16"</Code>.

    New Features 🚀
</NewsPageSubtitle>

<Paragraph>
    Many new features have been added in Blazorise 1.1, both small and large. The following is a list of a few of the larger features that we are excited about in no particular order. For a complete list of all changes you can check out our <Anchor To="https://github.com/Megabit/Blazorise/issues/3575">curated changelog</Anchor>, as well as the <Anchor To="https://github.com/Megabit/Blazorise/issues/3540">1.0.x fixes</Anchor>, which are also included in this release.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    .NET 7 Support
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    First, we must mention that Blazorise 1.1 fully supports the new .NET 7 SDK. Currently, it uses the last available RC1, so we will consider it a preview until the final version is released. But until then, you can safely use this version, which should behave like .NET 6.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    FocusTrap component
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    As a continuous work to improve <Anchor To="https://www.aoda.ca/web-accessibility-guidelines-for-compatibility-with-assistive-technology/">AODA compatibility</Anchor> we have created a new FocusTrap component. FocusTrap is a component that manages focus for its descendants. This is useful when implementing overlays such as modal dialogs, which should not allow the input focus to escape while open.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    The new component is already part of the <Code>Modal</Code> which can be controlled by setting the <Code>FocusTrap</Code> parameter. If you wish to use new component on its own then you can look at the example on the <Anchor To="docs/components/focus-trap">FocusTrap page</Anchor>.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    Highlighter component
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    This is a relatively small component, but it can be beneficial when designing the UI for your application. For example, it helps you visually distinguish parts of the text by highlighting them based on the search term.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    If you wish to use new component look at few of the examples we have created on the <Anchor To="docs/components/highlighter">Highlighter page</Anchor>.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    FluentValidation component
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    One of the most requested features we get from our community is a way to validate forms by using the <Anchor To="https://github.com/FluentValidation/FluentValidation" Title="Link to FluentValidation">FluentValidation</Anchor> library. In this Blazorise release, we are finally bringing it.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    The new <Strong>FluentValidation</Strong> component is created with the help of <Anchor To="https://github.com/aladotnet" Title="Link to GitHub user">aladotnet</Anchor>, a community member that has implemented the feature on his GitHub repository and was willing to give it away as part of the Blazorise core repository. Fortunately, he did all the hard work. As a result, we have only made minor optimizations to the API and added examples to the documentation.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    Big thanks to <Anchor To="https://github.com/aladotnet" Title="Link to GitHub user">aladotnet</Anchor> for his help in making it happen.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    DataGrid
</Heading>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is4">
    1. Sort Icon
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    Added <Code>ShowDefaultSortIcon</Code> parameter to <Code>DataGrid</Code>. By enabling this parameter, a default sort icon will now display.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is4">
    2. PagerOptions
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    Introduced <Code>PagerOptions</Code> with the following options:
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>

    <UnorderedList>
        <UnorderedListItem><Strong>Size</Strong> : Configures the pager buttons size.</UnorderedListItem>
        <UnorderedListItem><Strong>ButtonRowPosition</Strong> : Configures the button row position.</UnorderedListItem>
        <UnorderedListItem><Strong>PaginationPosition</Strong> : Configures the pagination position.</UnorderedListItem>
        <UnorderedListItem><Strong>TotalItemsPosition</Strong> : Configures the total items position.</UnorderedListItem>
    </UnorderedList>
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is4">
    3. ScrollRowOnEdit
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    Added <Code>ScrollRowOnEdit</Code> parameter to <Code>DataGrid</Code> <Code>VirtualizeOptions</Code>. When <Code>Virtualize</Code> is set, you may now disable the behaviour of scrolling the row to the top on edit when on <Code>DataGridEditMode.Inline</Code> or <Code>DataGridEditMode.Form</Code> by setting this new option to false.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is4">
    4. SelectedRowIndex
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    Added <Code>SelectedRowIndex</Code> getter to <Code>DataGrid</Code>. This is an helper so you can quickly find the Zero-based index of your <Code>SelectedRow</Code>. It can be an useful API in conjuction with the <Code>ScrollToRow</Code> method, that takes in a Zero-based index of <Code>DataGrid</Code> row to scroll to.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is4">
    5. SortOrder
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    Added <Code>SortOrder</Code> parameter to <Code>DataGrid</Code> so when the <Code>DataGrid</Code> sorting mechanism is set to multiple, you are able to configure the order of which the sorting of the columns takes place, this is specially useful, if you want to start the <Code>DataGrid</Code> sorted a certain way.
    Please do take note, that for the parameter to listen to changes and be able to dynamically be adjusted to the <Code>DataGrid</Code> changes, you should use <Code>bind-SortOrder</Code>.
    An example is when you have a Column A with a <Code>SortOrder</Code> of 2 And Column B with a <Code>SortOrder</Code> of 1, the moment the user removes the sorting out of Column B, the <Code>DataGrid</Code> will attempt to reset the <Code>SortOrder</Code> back to 0 as to accomodate the natural multiple sorting rules.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is4">
    6. PageSize
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    Increased default <Code>PageSize</Code> parameter value from <Strong>5</Strong> to <Strong>10</Strong>.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    ModalProvider
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    I believe this feature will be handy for a lot of people.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    FileEdit
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    The new ModalProvider component is used to programmatically render what custom content or component you want to instantiate inside your Modal, even with the support of parameters. The usage is similar to MessageProvider, but unlike it, we have more control over what will be rendered. For example, we can define to render entire pages or forms, and ModalProvider will automatically do it for you.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    The usage of new ModalProvider with examples can be see at <Anchor To="docs/services/modal-provider">ModalProvider page</Anchor>.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    Autocomplete
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    The Autocomplete component has received a lot of love in this release. Feature-wise, I believe it has the highest amount of new features compared to all other components.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is4">
    1. ReadData
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    Now it is possible to use the <Code>ReadData</Code> parameter to connect to an outside data source and load Autocomplete data on demand according to the user's searched text.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is4">
    2. SuggestSelectedItems
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    Introduced <Code>SuggestSelectedItems</Code> parameter, enabling you to to show up already selected items in the dropdown menu.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is4">
    3. AutocompleteSelectionMode
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    Introduced <Code>AutocompleteSelectionMode</Code>
    <UnorderedList>
        <UnorderedListItem><Strong>Default</Strong> : Default mode. Selection is single.</UnorderedListItem>
        <UnorderedListItem><Strong>Multiple</Strong> : Multiple mode. Selection is multiple.</UnorderedListItem>
        <UnorderedListItem><Strong>Checkbox</Strong> : Checkbox mode. Selection is multiple with checkbox selection support.</UnorderedListItem>
    </UnorderedList>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    You may still use the existing <Code>Multiple</Code> parameter to set the <Code>Autocomplete</Code> into Multiple selection mode, however take note that this Parameter has now been marked as <Code>Obsolete</Code> and will be removed in a future version. Please use the new <Code>SelectionMode</Code> Parameter.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is4">
    4. ConfirmKey
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    Introduced <Code>ConfirmKey</Code> parameter, you are now able to costumize the keyboard keys that should be considered as a Confirmation Key.
    Take note :
    If the value has a printed representation, this attribute's value is the same as the char attribute.
    Otherwise, it's one of the key value strings specified in 'Key values'.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    <Blockquote>
        Take note: If the value has a printed representation, this attribute's value is the same as the char attribute. Otherwise, it's one of the key value strings specified in 'Key values'.
    </Blockquote>
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is4">
    5. AutoPreSelect
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    Introduced <Code>AutoPreSelect</Code>, this defaults to true, keeping the current behaviour. By setting it to false, the dropdown that shows the options, will no longer auto select the first item.
    This is specially useful for a use case reported by our users.
    When you have the <Code>AutoComplete</Code> set to <Code>Multiple</Code> + <Code>FreeTyping</Code>, and want to allow your user to just press the Confirm Key to accept the currently typed text.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is4">
    6. Improved keyboard support
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    You can now select items and remove selection using keyboard alone. Use navigation arrows to select an item in the dropdown.In multi-select mode use Backspace to remove most recently selected item or use <Strong>Shift-Tab</Strong> and <Strong>Enter</Strong> key to remove any previously selected item.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    This feature is contributed by <Anchor To="https://github.com/glutio" Target="Target.Blank">glutio</Anchor>, one of our community members, and we thank you for all the effor he has done.

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    FileEdit
</Heading>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is4">
    1. Rendering Improvements
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    We've noticed that <Code>WriteToStreamAsync</Code> would not update progress on the UI and also freeze when using this API on WebAssembly. This is currently inherit to Blazor WebAssembly as it is single threaded, we've improved on this so the UI should now be able to update while using this API.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is4">
    2. Cancellation Support
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    Added missing <Code>CancellationToken</Code> to <Code>OpenReadStreamAsync</Code> so is is now possible to cancel the upload on demand.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is4">
    3. Byte Array Stream Support
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    Both <Code>WriteToStreamAsync</Code> and <Code>OpenReadStreamAsync</Code> should now be more performant as we made changes to accomodate the following new features in .NET6
    <Blazorise.Link To="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/javascript-interoperability/call-dotnet-from-javascript?view=aspnetcore-6.0#byte-array-support">Byte Array Support</Blazorise.Link>

    We now highly advise the usage of the <Code>OpenReadStreamAsync</Code> on Blazor WebAssembly as it is very performant.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    FilePicker
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    The new <Code>FilePicker</Code> will give you an enhanced File Upload control, with more out of the box options then our <Code>FileEdit</Code> component.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    ListView
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    Introduced <Code>ItemTemplate</Code> parameter, you may now costumize the content that renders in each of the <Code>ListView</Code>'s items.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    Introduced a much needed missing <Code>ValueField</Code> Parameter, so you may uniquely identify each item in your list.
    This has been introduced with a return value of <Code>String</Code> for now. However we plan to make it return a generic type <Code>TValue</Code> in a future version, much like some of our other <Code>ValueField</Code> based components, so you can choose what type does your unique value return.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    Loading Indicator
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    This excellent component is done by <Anchor To="https://github.com/glutio" Target="Target.Blank">glutio</Anchor>, one of our community members. The amount of work that went into it is astounding. The purpose of this component is, as its names suggest, to indicate to the user that a long-running operation is happening. It supports many different working scenarios, like two-way binding, methods calls via reference, global control through the service, and many more.

    Steps Navigation
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    This feature was created by <Anchor To="https://github.com/Jimmys20">Jimmys20</Anchor>, one of our community members.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    Basic steps navigation has no constraints, so it is possible to jump to any steps by clicking on them. However, this is usually impossible in real-world scenarios as sometimes a user is required to enter valid data before proceeding to the next step.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    To control the navigation between the steps, it is now possible to use <Code>NavigationAllowed</Code> parameter, which acts as a function that has all the information you need to validate the page switch.
