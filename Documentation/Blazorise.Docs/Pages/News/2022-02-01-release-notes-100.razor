<Paragraph>
    No big release can be done without some breaking changes and this release is no exception...
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    <Strong>1.</Strong> Since a lot was changed to support ChartJS v3 the migration would take too long to explain so it is best to follow the the migration guide at https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/getting-started/v3-migration.html as a general rule.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    Chart v3
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    In this release, we bring long-awaited support for ChartJS v3. Unfortunately, it was not possible to leave support for previous versions considering there were too many breaking changes between the version.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    With Chart v3 we now support almost all of the <Code>v3</Code> configuration settings. We took great care to document most of the dataset and option fields so that IntelliSense will give you suggestions on how to properly define the chart.
</Paragraph>

    Highlights 🚀

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    Video
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    We worked hard to bring you very new <Code Tag>Video</Code> component which is based upon the excellent <Anchor To="https://plyr.io/" Target="Target.Blank">Plyr</Anchor> video player. The new component fully supports streaming media by implementing both <Anchor To="https://github.com/video-dev/hls.js/">HLS</Anchor> and <Anchor To="https://github.com/Dash-Industry-Forum/dash.js">DASH</Anchor> playback media format.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    The component is fairly flexible to use and has most of the video control methods like <Code>Play()</Code>, <Code>Pause()</Code>, and <Code>Stop()</Code>, and many others; including also events that can give you current state of the player.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    The new component and it's usage can be seen at <Anchor To="docs/extensions/video">Video page</Anchor>.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    Modal
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    We reworked animations so you can have more control. We added two new Parameters:
    <UnorderedList>
        <UnorderedListItem>
            IsAnimated : Controls whether the modal should animate.
        </UnorderedListItem>
        <UnorderedListItem>
            AnimationDuration : Sets the modal animation duration in ms.
        </UnorderedListItem>
    </UnorderedList>
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    DataGrid
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    Added ScrollTo Api to Datagrid. You may now use the ScrollToRow and ScrollToPixels API when FixedHeader or Virtualize is set on your DataGrid.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    FileEdit
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    Added MaxFileSize Parameter, this will default to long.MaxValue
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    Added FileInvalidReason to the FileEndedEventArgs so you may track what went wrong in case the file upload was not successfull.
</Paragraph>

<UnorderedList>
    <UnorderedListItem>None</UnorderedListItem>
    <UnorderedListItem>MaxLengthExceeded</UnorderedListItem>
    <UnorderedListItem>UnexpectedBufferChunkLength</UnorderedListItem>
    <UnorderedListItem>TaskCancelled</UnorderedListItem>
    <UnorderedListItem>UnexpectedError</UnorderedListItem>
</UnorderedList>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    NumericPicker
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    The new <Code>NumericPicker</Code> component is created as an alternative to the <Code>NumericEdit</Code> component.
    All the formating features from <Code>NumericEdit</Code> are moved to the component. This breaking change was needed because
    we felt there was no need to support two similar  behavior components. So, <Code>NumericEdit</Code> is left to serve as
    a native HTML input element, and all the custom and advanced stuff is not part of the new <Code>NumericPicker</Code>.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    The new <Code>NumericPicker</Code> component has many new features like currency mask, group separators, configurable
    rounding methods, proper min and max input mode, and many more. So we hope the new <Code>NumericPicker</Code> will serve you well.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    Auto Complete
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    Introduced <Code>CloseOnSelection</Code> Parameter. You will be able to set this parameter to false, so the auto complete's dropdown does not close on selection.
    <strong>Note:</strong> This feature will only work with multiple selection.
</Paragraph>
