    Migration 🛠

<Paragraph>
    <Strong>1.</Strong> Since a lot was changed to support ChartJS v3 the migration would take too long to explain so it is best to follow the the migration guide at https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/getting-started/v3-migration.html as a general rule.

    Chart v3
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    In this release, we bring long-awaited support for ChartJS v3. Unfortunately, it was not possible to leave support for previous versions considering there were too many breaking changes between the version.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    With Chart v3 we now support almost all of the <Code>v3</Code> configuration settings. We took great care to document most of the dataset and option fields so that IntelliSense will give you suggestions on how to properly define the chart.
