    Why We're Removing the Program
</NewsPageSubtitle>

<Paragraph>
    The affiliate program was originally introduced to reward community members for helping expand Blazorise's reach. However, over time it was increasingly used in ways that did not align with its intended purpose. Misuse by individuals created complications and additional workload that distracted us from focusing on improving Blazorise itself.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    After careful consideration, we determined that maintaining the affiliate program was no longer sustainable or beneficial for the community or our team.
</Paragraph>

<NewsPageSubtitle>
    Effective Immediately

<Paragraph>
    The affiliate program has been permanently discontinued effective immediately. All related links, dashboards, and commissions are no longer active. We understand this may disappoint some users who participated in good faith, and we truly appreciate their support.

<Paragraph>
    Moving forward, we will continue to focus our efforts on providing the best possible components, documentation, and support for Blazorise users without the complications introduced by the affiliate system.
