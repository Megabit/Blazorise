    New Features & Enhancements 🚀
</NewsPageSubtitle>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    .NET 9 Support
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    Blazorise now fully supports .NET 9. This update ensures compatibility with the latest .NET version, allowing you to leverage the newest features and enhancements in your Blazor applications. By upgrading to .NET 9, you can take advantage of improved performance, security, and productivity benefits, while maintaining seamless integration with Blazorise components and utilities.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    Autocomplete
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    Previously, the Autocomplete component had a limitation in handling repeated text values. With this update, Autocomplete now supports repeated text entries, allowing you to include multiple items with the same display text. Note that while texts can be repeated, the values must still be unique to ensure proper functionality. This enhancement adds flexibility when working with datasets that include duplicate display names.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    Object Fit Utility
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    The ObjectFit utility is designed to give developers precise control over how elements fit within their containers. With options like Default, None, Contain, Cover, Fill, and Scale, you can adapt content to fit within various containers while preserving or adjusting the aspect ratio. Additionally, a fluent interface, IFluentObjectFit, is provided for easier configuration and application of these styles. This utility ensures responsive design and performance improvements, making it easier to achieve consistent and adaptable layouts across different devices and screen sizes.
</Paragraph>

<NewsPageImageModal ImageSource="img/news/170/objectfit.png" ImageTitle="Object Fit Utility" />

<Paragraph>
    This utility is especially useful for HTML <Anchor To="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Replaced_element">replaced element</Anchor> such as <Code Tag>img</Code>, <Code Tag>video</Code>, <Code Tag>iframe</Code>.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    Be sure to update your projects to incorporate these new capabilities and refer to the <Anchor To="docs/helpers/utilities/object-fit">updated documentation</Anchor> for guidance on implementation.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    Video Improvements
</Heading>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is4">
    Disable Fullscreen Mode
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    Added <Code>DoubleClickToFullscreen</Code> parameter to the <Code Tag>Video</Code> component. This parameter allows you to enable or disable the fullscreen mode when the video is double-clicked.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is4">
    Set Playback Rate
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    Added <Code>SetPlaybackRate</Code> method to the <Code Tag>Video</Code> component. This method allows you to manually set the playback rate of the video. This can be useful if you want to speed up or slow down the video playback.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is4">
    Controls Delay
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    Added <Code>ControlsDelay</Code> parameter to the <Code Tag>Video</Code> component. This parameter allows you to define the delay in milliseconds while media playback is progressing without user activity to indicate an idle state and hide controls.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    Tooltip Delay
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    Added an option to delay the tooltip show and hide events with the new <Code>ShowDelay</Code>, and <Code>HideDelay</Code> parameters. This can be useful if you want to prevent the tooltip from showing immediately after the trigger event.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    Along with the options to define delay on each individual Tooltip, we have also added a global options to define the delay for all tooltips. This can be done by setting the <Code>TooltipOptions</Code> property in the <Code>.AddBlazorise()</Code> during the application start process.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    New Table FixedColumnsPositionSync Parameter
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    The new <Code>FixedColumnsPositionSync</Code> parameter in the Table component enables ongoing synchronization of fixed columns. This feature is particularly useful when adding new columns dynamically, as it recalculates the column positions to maintain the layout integrity. By keeping columns aligned, this parameter helps ensure a consistent and visually cohesive table structure, even as content changes.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    DataGrid
</Heading>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is4">
    New Between Filter Method
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    Now available on number and date columns when the Filter Mode is set to Menu. The <Code>DataGridColumnFilterMethod.Between</Code> method enables filtering by a range of values, improving precision and flexibility.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    The filtering mechanism was reworked such that SearchValue can now contain a range of values. This allows for more advanced filtering options, such as filtering by a range of dates or numbers. The new <Code>DataGridColumnFilterMethod.Between</Code> option enables you to filter data based on a range of values, providing greater flexibility and precision in your filtering criteria.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is4">
    New Parameter FixedColumnsPositionSync
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    Added <Code>FixedColumnsPositionSync</Code> parameter. This parameter allows you to keep synchronizing the fixed columns positions. This is useful when you want to be adding new columns dynamically, and the columns need to be recalculated.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is4">
    SelectedCell API
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    Added <Code>SelectedCell</Code> and <Code>SelectedCellChanged</Code> parameters, you can now listen to the cell selection changes when the <Code>Datagrid.NavigationMode</Code> is set to <Code>NavigationMode.Cell</Code>
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is4">
    DataGridDateColumn
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    Replaced the rendered <Code>DateEdit</Code> component by a <Code>DatePicker</Code>. This change provides you with improved flexibility over the limitations of the <Code>DateEdit</Code>. You will find new <Code>DatePicker</Code> parameters in the <Code>DataGridDateColumn</Code> to further customize how your date behaves.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is4">
    Column Text Styling
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    Added <Code>TextTransform</Code>, <Code>TextDecoration</Code>, <Code>TextWeight</Code>, <Code>TextOverflow</Code>, and <Code>TextSize</Code> parameters to the <Code>DataGridColumn</Code> component. This will allow you to easily style the text in the DataGrid.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    All the new text styling parameters are also available for headers, filter, and aggregate cells of the DataGrid.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is4">
    Undeprecate CellClass and CellStyle
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    After our community has convinced us that these parameters are still useful, we have decided to undeprecate them. We have undeprecated the <Code>CellClass</Code> and <Code>CellStyle</Code> parameters in the <Code>DataGridColumn</Code> component. These parameters allow you to define the class and style for the cell based on the cell item value.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    TreeView Virtualization
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    With the new virtualization capability, the TreeView component efficiently manages large datasets by only rendering nodes currently in view. This improvement is especially useful for applications with extensive hierarchical structures, as it minimizes memory usage and reduces load times, resulting in faster interaction and smoother scrolling.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    By limiting the number of rendered DOM elements, TreeView virtualization not only enhances performance but also improves the overall user experience, making navigation through large node structures more responsive and manageable.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    New PdfViewer Component
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    We are excited to introduce the new PdfViewer component in version 1.7. This component provides a powerful and flexible solution for rendering PDF documents within your application. With this release, you can now easily integrate PDF viewing capabilities directly into your projects, using a simple and intuitive API. The PdfViewer supports a variety of features, including zooming and page navigation, and can be used both standalone or in conjunction with other components like PdfViewerToolbar.
</Paragraph>

<NewsPageImageModal ImageSource="img/news/170/pdfviewer.png" ImageTitle="PdfViewer Component" />

<Paragraph>
    In this initial release, the PdfViewer supports read-only mode, allowing users to view and navigate through PDF files. We are planning to add text selection and other interactive features in future updates.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    For detailed usage instructions and integration examples, please visit the <Anchor To="docs/extensions/pdfviewer">PdfViewer documentation</Anchor>.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    New RouterTabs Component
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    We are excited to introduce the new RouterTabs component! Once set up, this component automatically generates tabs for each page that the user navigates to, streamlining tabbed navigation across your application.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    For further details and setup instructions, check out the <Anchor To="docs/extensions/routertabs" Title="RouterTabs Docs">RouterTabs Documentation</Anchor>.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    Updated Icons
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    All icons have been updated to use <Code>public const string</Code> instead of <Code>public static readonly string</Code>. While this change does not affect how icons are used, it makes the code cleaner and more readable. Additionally, this update enables the use of named icons within attributes, providing greater flexibility in customization.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    FontAwesome icons have also been upgraded to version 6.6.0, bringing new icons and fixes to some existing ones. This enhancement ensures that your applications have access to the latest icon options and improvements.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    This change was made by our community member <Anchor To="https://github.com/mtbayley" Title="Link to mtbayley">mtbayley</Anchor>. We are grateful for his contribution and we are looking forward to more contributions from him.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    RichTextEdit Table Support
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    Implementing table support in the RichTextEdit component presented unexpected challenges. Initially, we anticipated a straightforward addition, but upon further investigation, we found that table support in RichTextEdit remains minimal and largely experimental.
</Paragraph>

<NewsPageImageModal ImageSource="img/news/170/rtetable.png" ImageTitle="RichTextEdit Table Support" />

<Paragraph>
    To address these limitations, we explored alternative solutions and identified a community-developed table module that, while unofficial, provided a workable option. By integrating this module into Blazorise's RichTextEdit, we were able to achieve a functional outcome for table support.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    Since this module is unofficial, we have marked table support in RichTextEdit as experimental. This designation will remain until Quill.js releases an official table module.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    Text Decoration Utility
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    The latest update introduces flexible text decoration options in Blazorise. You can now easily apply underline, line-through, and overline styles to text, or remove decorations altogether with the none option. These enhancements allow for more refined text styling and improved design flexibility in your applications.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    For more details and examples, visit the <Anchor To="docs/components/typography" Title="Link to Text Decoration documentation">Text Decoration documentation</Anchor>.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    Radio Group Button Colors
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    You can now customize the color of RadioGroup buttons by setting the <Code>Color</Code> property on the <Code>Radio</Code> component.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    This feature allows for easy differentiation between options within the RadioGroup, enhancing the visual appeal of your forms and providing a more tailored user experience.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    Charts Tooltip Callbacks
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    The new <Code>Callbacks</Code> parameter in <Code>ChartTooltip</Code> options enables you to define custom callbacks for tooltips. This can be particularly useful when you want to customize tooltip content or appearance based on specific data points.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    Please note that this feature is experimental. The callbacks work by converting a C# lambda into a JavaScript function, which is then passed to Chart.js. Since the JavaScript function cannot directly access the C# context, extra care is needed when using this feature.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    ToastProvider Improvements
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    The ToastProvider component, a versatile helper for displaying alerts and notifications, has received valuable enhancements. It now includes options to handle <Code>Opening</Code> and <Code>Closing</Code> events, allowing you to perform specific actions before a toast is shown or hidden.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    These improvements make the ToastProvider even more flexible, providing greater control over notification timing and behavior within your applications.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    Skeleton
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    The new Skeleton component enhances user experience by providing loading placeholders for components or pages. These placeholders visually indicate that content is loading or temporarily unavailable, helping manage user expectations and improve perceived performance. The Skeleton component is highly customizable, allowing you to seamlessly integrate it into your projects for a polished, professional appearance.
</Paragraph>

<NewsPageImageModal ImageSource="img/news/170/skeleton.png" ImageTitle="Skeleton Component" />

<Paragraph>
    For more information on how to use the Skeleton component and customize loading placeholders, refer to the <Anchor To="docs/components/skeleton">Skeleton documentation</Anchor>.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    Improved Flex Utilities
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    Our Fluent Flex utilities have been enhanced to allow for more responsive and adaptable layouts. Previously, defining breakpoint-specific flex rules was not supported, making it challenging to set distinct flex behavior across breakpoints. With this update, you can now define flex rules separately for each breakpoint and specify the order of flex rules, giving you finer control over layout responsiveness and flexibility.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    BarItem Cursor Default Behavior
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    Previously, hovering over the <Code Tag>BarItem</Code> displayed a pointer cursor by default. However, this behavior led to issues with disabled buttons, where a standard cursor is more appropriate and better aligns with UX principles.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    Buttons and links inside the <Code Tag>BarItem</Code> will still show the pointer cursor as before. If you have a <Code Tag>div</Code> inside a <Code Tag>BarItem</Code>, the default cursor behavior has been updated to reflect these UX improvements.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    New DatePicker EnabledDates
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    The <Code>EnabledDates</Code> property in the <Code Tag>DatePicker</Code> component allows you to specify a set of selectable dates, restricting users to choose only from these predefined dates. This feature is especially useful when limiting date selections to specific, valid options, enhancing date selection control in your applications.
</Paragraph>

<NewsPageImageModal ImageSource="img/news/170/enableddates.png" ImageTitle="DatePicker EnabledDates" />

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    DropZone Reordering
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    The <Code>Reordered</Code> callback has been added to the <Code>DropZone</Code> component. This callback triggers whenever items within the <Code>DropZone</Code> are reordered, allowing you to perform additional actions in response to item reordering. This enhancement adds flexibility for managing dynamic lists and collections within your application.
</Paragraph>

<NewsPageSubtitle>
    Blazorise Optimizations
</NewsPageSubtitle>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    Refactored Class Providers
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    Blazorise has undergone substantial internal optimizations to make it even more adaptable for customizations. While these changes may not be immediately visible, they bring powerful benefits if you’re implementing a custom CSS provider or design system.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    Specifically, we’ve updated the signatures of many <Code>IClassProvider</Code> methods to accept extra attributes. This adjustment grants each CSS provider greater control over how class names are assigned and rendered, offering more flexibility for unique design implementations.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    Strongly Typed JS Interop API
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    In line with our ongoing efforts to streamline code and enhance performance, we’ve introduced a new strongly typed JS interop API. This API provides a type-safe, intuitive approach for interacting with JavaScript directly from C#, simplifying work with JavaScript objects and functions in Blazor applications.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    This enhancement improves code readability and maintainability while enabling safer testing and debugging, resulting in a more robust development experience with Blazorise.
</Paragraph>

<NewsPageSubtitle>
