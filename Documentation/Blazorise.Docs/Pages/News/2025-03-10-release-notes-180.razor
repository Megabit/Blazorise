<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    Optimized Chart Plugins
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    This release introduces a major optimization to the Chart plugin system by centralizing shared logic and lifecycle handling within the ChartPlugin base class. By moving common properties, initialization, and disposal routines into a unified location, the update significantly reduces duplicated code across individual plugins and simplifies their overall structure. This change also enhances how plugins are connected to BaseChart, resulting in cleaner integration and more reliable async event handling between charts and their plugins.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    The refactoring addresses longstanding pain points related to plugin lifecycle management and ensures that disposal and initialization are consistently handled. This unified approach not only improves maintainability but also helps prevent potential bugs across all plugins. As part of this effort, it was also noted that some plugins, such as the Streaming plugin, may require implementations of methods like OnParametersSetAsync to ensure all configuration parameters are properly updated during the component lifecycle.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    Renamed Chart Options
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    We had a wrongly named option on the <Code>DoughnutChartOptions</Code>, and <Code>PieChartOptions</Code> classes. The <Code>CutoutPercentage</Code> property has been renamed to <Code>Cutout</Code>. This change aligns with the Chart.js documentation and ensures consistency across the API. Since the field was already wrongly named, this change should not break any existing code. However, if you were using the <Code>CutoutPercentage</Code> property, you will need to update your code to use the new <Code>Cutout</Code> property.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    To make it more flexible we have also made it an <Code>object</Code> type, so you can use it as a percentage or a number. This change allows you to specify the cutout value in either pixels or as a percentage of the chart's radius, providing greater flexibility in how you configure your charts.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    Autocomplete: Disabled Items
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    The <Code>Autocomplete</Code> component now supports disabling specific items in the suggestion list. You can provide a function to determine which items should be inactive, preventing users from selecting them. This is helpful in cases where some options shouldn't be available for interaction.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    Export Semantic HTML for RichTextEdit
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    The <Code>RichTextEdit</Code> component now includes an <Code>GetHtmlAsync</Code> overload that allows you to export the current content as semantic HTML. This is particularly useful for applications that require clean and structured HTML output, such as when saving or sharing content.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    RichTextEdit Image and Video Resizing
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    We've introduced a new resizing feature for images and videos within the <Code>RichTextEdit</Code> component. Users can now directly resize multimedia content within the editor, enhancing flexibility and providing a smoother editing experience.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    This functionality can be conveniently enabled or disabled via the <Code>UseResize</Code> parameter, allowing easy customization to meet your project's specific needs.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    Multiple Highlights Support for Highlighter
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    The <code>Highlighter</code> component now supports highlighting multiple phrases within the same text using the new <code>HighlightedTexts</code> parameter. This enhancement allows developers to pass a list of strings to be highlighted simultaneously, replacing the previous limitation of only a single <code>HighlightedText</code>. The update enables more dynamic and flexible highlighting scenarios, such as multi-word search, filtering, and complex keyword matching — all with minimal changes to existing implementations.
</Paragraph>

    Chart Zoom Plugin

The new API are <Code>Zoomed</Code>, <Code>SetZoomLevel</Code>, and <Code>GetZoomLevel</Code>, and <Code>ResetZoomLevel</Code>. These new APIs provide a more intuitive and flexible way to manage zoom levels in your charts. The <Code>Zoomed</Code> event is triggered when the chart is zoomed, allowing you to respond to zoom changes in real-time. The <Code>SetZoomLevel</Code> method allows you to programmatically set the zoom level of the chart, while the <Code>GetZoomLevel</Code> method allows you to retrieve the current zoom level. Finally, the <Code>ResetZoomLevel</Code> method allows you to reset the zoom level of the chart to its original state.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    The <Code>ChartZoom</Code> plugin has been updated to support the latest <Code>chartjs-plugin-zoom.js</Code> version.

    Steps Lazy Loading
