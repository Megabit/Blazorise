    Commercial Support
</NewsPageSubtitle>

<Paragraph>
    Blazorise, an open-source component library, is maintained by Megabit Ltd, a small organization based in Croatia. We are strong advocates of the open-source ecosystem, which is why we offer Blazorise through our Community licenses at no cost. However, if you are part of a large organization and would like to support the project, we suggest purchasing a commercial license to help us maintain a sustainable business. This will enable us to continue developing Blazorise.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    With a commercial license, you will have access to premium forum support, private repositories and community-licensed themes. To learn more about commercial licenses, please visit our website at <Anchor To="https://blazorise.com/commercial" Target="Target.Blank">Blazorise Commercial</Anchor>.
