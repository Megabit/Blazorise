    Cropper Component
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    When building an application, best practice requires reducing an image's surrounding noise and directing a user's attention to a specific part of the image. Image cropping is a method for manipulating images to remove any unwanted elements. By changing the aspect ratio or orientation, we can draw viewers' eyes to the photograph's primary subject and improve the overall composition. This applies to profile pictures or uploading images with specific dimensions.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    The new <Code>Cropper</Code> component handles all of that. You can now upload an image and then select part of it, rotate, scale, and crop it. You can also add a preview by adding a <Code>CropperViewer</Code> whenever on a page, and it will automatically synchronize with the latest selection.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    As with many other components, the Cropper component is also created with the help of our community member <Link To="https://github.com/njannink">njannink</Link>. We will need to send him a larger MVC award gift next year 😊.
