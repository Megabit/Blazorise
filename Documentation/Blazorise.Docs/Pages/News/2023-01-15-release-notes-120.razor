    Tailwind CSS Provider
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    As part of our ongoing efforts to improve and enhance the functionality of Blazorise, we are excited to announce the release of a new <Link To="https://tailwindcss.com/" Title="Tailwind CSS">Tailwind CSS</Link> provider for Blazorise, which was created on top of <Link To="https://flowbite.com/" Title="Link to Flowbite">Flowbite</Link> with the courtesy of their creators.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    For those unfamiliar with Tailwind CSS, it is a utility-first CSS framework that allows developers to easily style their applications by providing a wide range of pre-designed classes that can be applied directly to HTML elements. It is a popular choice for many developers because of its simplicity and flexibility.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    With the new Tailwind CSS provider for Blazorise, you can easily apply Tailwind styles to your Blazor components and take advantage of all the benefits that Tailwind has to offer. This provider is fully integrated with Blazorise and allows you to use all the features of Blazorise while still benefiting from the power of Tailwind.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    To get started with the new Tailwind CSS provider, simply install the latest version of Blazorise and add the Tailwind CSS provider to your project by following our <Link To="docs/usage/tailwind" Title="Link to Tailwind Guide">startup guide</Link>.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    We would like to extend a special thank you to the creators of <Link To="https://flowbite.com/" Title="Link to Flowbite">Flowbite</Link> for their contribution in making this provider possible.

The new DataLabels component is made possible with the help of <Anchor To="https://chartjs-plugin-datalabels.netlify.app/" Title="Link to chart DataLabels plugin" Target="Target.Blank">chartjs-plugin-datalabels</Anchor>.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    LottieAnimation extension
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    The LottieAnimation component allows you to easily incorporate beautiful, customizable animations into your Blazor applications using the <Link To="https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-web">Lottie</Link> Javascript library. The library's purpose is to allow applications to directly render animations exported from Adobe After Effects without needing to recreate the animation by hand in the HTML. It is simple to use and provides a seamless integration with Blazorise.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    We are grateful to <Link To="https://github.com/smfields">smfields</Link> for their contribution to the Blazorise community and for bringing this exciting new feature to our users.

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    Cropper Component
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    When building an application, best practice requires reducing an image's surrounding noise and directing a user's attention to a specific part of the image. Image cropping is a method for manipulating images to remove any unwanted elements. By changing the aspect ratio or orientation, we can draw viewers' eyes to the photograph's primary subject and improve the overall composition. This applies to profile pictures or uploading images with specific dimensions.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    The new <Code>Cropper</Code> component handles all of that. You can now upload an image and then select part of it, rotate, scale, and crop it. You can also add a preview by adding a <Code>CropperViewer</Code> whenever on a page, and it will automatically synchronize with the latest selection.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    As with many other components, the Cropper component is also created with the help of our community member <Link To="https://github.com/njannink">njannink</Link>. We will need to send him a larger MVC award gift next year 😊.

    Lead component
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    This component allows users to easily apply a larger, bolder font style to important text on their web pages, making it stand out and draw the reader's attention.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    This new component can be used to wrap any text element, and includes customization options for font size, font weight, and text color.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    AccordionToggle component
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    We have introduced a new AccordionToggle component that should be used instead of the Button component when building an Accordion.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    The Button component is no longer recommended for use inside an Accordion and may cause unexpected behavior. Using the AccordionToggle component will ensure that your Accordion functions as intended.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    To update your code, simply replace any instances of <Code Tag>Button</Code> inside your Accordion with <Code Tag>AccordionToggle</Code>.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    Autocomplete improvements
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    Blazorise Autocomplete now includes a search highlight feature that allows users to easily locate items in the dropdown list. When a search value is entered, the matching items in the dropdown will be highlighted, making it easier to find and select the desired item. This feature is particularly useful when working with large lists of items and helps improve the overall user experience.
