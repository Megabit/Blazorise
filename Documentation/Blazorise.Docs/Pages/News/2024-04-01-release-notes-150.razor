    New Features & Enhancements 🚀

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    DataGrid improvements

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is4">
    1. State Management
</Heading>
<Paragraph>
    We've introduced a way that allows you to save and load the DataGrid state on demand using a centralized api. 
    You can use the new <code>LoadState</code> and <code>GetState</code> methods to load and get the DataGrid state.
    Please find an example of how to use this feature in the <Link To="docs/extensions/datagrid/features/state-management">DataGrid State Management</Link> page.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    ModalProvider improvements
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    We've now added the ability to keep the state of a modal even after it has been closed by being able to keep the instances in memory.
    This feature is activated by setting the new <code>Stateful</code> parameter to true. 
    This parameter has been added to both the <Code>ModalProvider</Code> and <Code>ModalInstanceOptions</Code>.
    Please find more information about how this feature works in the <Link To="docs/services/modal-provider">ModalProvider</Link> page.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    Captcha
</Heading>    

<Paragraph>
    We're excited to introduce a new component <Code>Captcha</Code>! This component is used to help prevent fake users or malicious software from taking action on your website.
    This component may support various providers in the future. Currently we are introducing the first Captcha provider, a wrapper around the Google reCAPTCHA service.
    Find out more at <Link To="docs/extensions/captcha">Captcha</Link> page.
