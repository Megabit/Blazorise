    Why the Change?
</NewsPageSubtitle>

<Paragraph>
    As a European-based company, specifically headquartered in Croatia, EU regulations require us to display pricing in euros, our official national currency. While our previous use of USD was convenient for international customers, the legal obligations for EU-based businesses dictate that pricing transparency and consistency must be in EUR.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    Moreover, this change is also influenced by ongoing global economic fluctuations and the continued depreciation of the US dollar. Converting our pricing model to EUR provides stability and reduces exposure to currency volatility, benefiting both our business operations and our customers.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    We believe this shift will bring greater clarity and simplicity for our European customers and streamline the purchasing process.
</Paragraph>

<NewsPageSubtitle>
    Immediate Implementation
</NewsPageSubtitle>

<Paragraph>
    The new EUR pricing is effective immediately, and all new subscriptions or renewals will reflect this change. Existing subscriptions will transition to EUR pricing upon renewal. Please note that while our base prices are now shown in EUR, the actual prices have not changed. These EUR prices were always available and equivalent in value—they were simply shown only at checkout based on the customer's location and currency. Now, we are making them visible by default for full transparency. Customers will still be charged in their local currency based on current exchange rates.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    We thank you for your understanding and continued support as we make this necessary adjustment to better serve our global and especially European customers.
