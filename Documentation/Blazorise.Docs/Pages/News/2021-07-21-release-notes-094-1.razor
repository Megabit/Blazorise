    There can never be any big release without some small issues. Blazorise <Code>v0.9.4</Code> is no exception so we
    bring you all the bug fixes reported since the launch day.

<Paragraph>
    A lot of times we get reports regarding the JavaScript interop and having an invalid operation. Mostly the problem
    is because browsers tend to cache JS and CSS files and then are using an older version than the current application
    is expecting. The solution to the problem is easy. You just need to add a version parameter to the JS and CSS files
    whenever you update Blazorise, eg. <Code>v=0.9.4.1</Code>.
