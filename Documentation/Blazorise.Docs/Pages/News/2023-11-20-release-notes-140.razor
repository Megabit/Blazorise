    New Features & Enhancements 🚀

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    DatePicker input mask
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    With the feedback from our community, we've introduced a new <Code>InputFormat</Code> parameter for the input mask. This feature lets developers define the format that the input should adhere to, ensuring consistency and data integrity.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    At this moment almost all date formats should be supported. The only feature that is still missing is the usage of long-name days and month, eg <Code>ddd.MM.yyyy</Code>, or <Code>dd.MMM.yyyy</Code>. We are working on making it work in future versions.
