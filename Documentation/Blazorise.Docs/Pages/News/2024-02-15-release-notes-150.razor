    New Features & Enhancements 🚀
</NewsPageSubtitle>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    Fluent UI 2
</Heading>

<Paragraph>

</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    Toast component
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    We have introduced a new Toast component. Toasts are brief alerts made to resemble push notifications, which are more common on desktop and mobile devices. Since they are flexbox-built, they are simple to align and reposition.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    Please find an example of how to use this component in the <Anchor To="docs/components/toast" Title="Link to Toast page">Toast</Anchor> page.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    DataGrid improvements
</Heading>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is4">
    1. State Management
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    We've introduced a way that allows you to save and load the DataGrid state on demand using a centralized api. You can use the new <Code>LoadState</Code> and <code>GetState</code> methods to load and get the DataGrid state.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    Please find an example of how to use this feature in the <Anchor To="docs/extensions/datagrid/features/state-management" Title="Link to DataGrid State Management">DataGrid State Management</Anchor> page.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is4">
    2. PreventRowClick
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    Added support for TableRowCell to preventDefault and stopPropagation events on cell click, ClickPreventDefault and ClickStopPropagation respectively.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    Resolved an issue where the DataGrid PreventRowClick was not working as expected.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is4">
    3. Column Chooser
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    Enable Column Chooser by setting <Code>ColumnChooser</Code> to true to allow users to show or hide columns in the DataGrid.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is4">
    4. DataGridColumn AggregateTemplate
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    Introduced an <Code>AggregateTemplate</Code> Parameter to the <Code>DataGridColumn</Code>.
    This new Parameter fixes a gap in functionality where it was not possible to set an aggregate template for the <Code>DataGridColumn</Code> and <Code>DataGridMultiSelectColumn</Code>
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    Indeterminate progress bars
</Heading>

<Paragraph>

</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    Accordion dedicated components
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    We have introduced new components that are now used specifically within accordion. In the past for collapsible regions within the <Code>Accordion</Code> we used the <Code>Collapse</Code> component. This had several problems but mainly we had to internally wire to callapse what is not directly related to it. By making the collapse usage obsolete and introducing new accordion cimponent to replace it we are now much flexible and we can have more room for improvements in the future.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    The Collapse will still continue to work, but in the future you should expect it to be completelly revobed from the Accordion.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    Font Awesome icons
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    We have mapped the latest icons from Font Awesome v6 branch. This enables you to use pick from larger number of icons names in your project.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    In this version we're introducing some changes to how Font Awesome are consumed. The <Strong>Blazorise.Icons.FontAwesome</Strong> package now contains the all icons for <Strong>v5.x</Strong>, and <Strong>v6.x</Strong> FontAwesome. This change was needed because that FontAwesome doesn't have CDN for <Strong>v6.x</Strong> icons. By packaging them into Blazorise we give you a heads-up to use them. And if you want to have your own CDN you can always use it as an alternative.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    Please be aware that after we merged <Strong>FontAWesome v6.x</Strong> some icons from the <Strong>v5.x</Strong> might not work correctly. It is adwised to update CSS link to use the latest <Strong>v6.x</Strong> CSS.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    Show Tooltips on Rating
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    Now it is possible to show an extra information on the <Code>Rating</Code> component. By defining the <Code>GetTooltip</Code> callback you can show the tooltip to indicate what is the rating value that it represents.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    DropdownList
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    Added a new Parameter <Code>DisabledItem</Code>. By defining this, you can set the disabled items from the supplied data source.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    Autocomplete
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    We've reworked the <Code>Autocomplete</Code> <Code>SelectionMode.Checkbox</Code> so it more closely follows the standard look of the checkboxes across the application.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    Responsive font sizes
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    Adjusting font sizes for multiple screen sizes can be challenging. That's why we have made it possible to define different sizes for different screen sizes. This is made possible with out flexible "fluent-based" utilities.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    Defining the font size follows the same pattern as all out fluent-based utilties, eg. <Code>TextSize="TextSize.IsLarge.OnMobile.IsSmall.OnDesktop"</Code>.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    Validation API
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    To make it easier to customize Blazorise behavior, we have exposed some internal <Code>Validation</Code>, and <Code>Validations</Code> component APIs and made them public. This will enable more customization to your forms and make it possible to implement new validation methods.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    New Breakpoints
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    We have introduced new XXL Breakpoints(QuadHD alias) that is supposed to be used on extra large screens, like 2K and above. This will enable more fine control over what can be visible on screen for thos large screens.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    Bar
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    Introduced a new <Code>BarMenuToggleBehavior</Code>.
    By default, it is set to <Code>BarMenuToggleBehavior.AllowMultipleMenus</Code> which will keep all the menus you toggle open.
    You can also set it to <Code>BarMenuToggleBehavior.AllowSingleMenu</Code> to only keep a menu open at a time.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    RichTextEdit
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    As with many other features in this release we have updated internals of RichTextEdit to work with the latest version of <Anchor To="https://github.com/quilljs/quill" Title="Link to Quill JS">Quill JS</Anchor> library. This update means there will be less security risks that were reported by using an older version.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    We also made dynamic loading of RichTextEdit JS obsolete, and made it work similar to all other Blazorise components. JavaScript is now loaded as a JS module.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    AntDesign upgrade to latest 4.x version
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    In this release, we've updated our AntDesign provider. Previously, we were using the older 4.0 version of AntDesign, which didn't do justice to this exceptional framework. Although we aim to upgrade to the latest AntDesign 5.1 version in the upcoming Blazorise milestone, this update addresses several issues identified while developing Blazorise 1.5.
