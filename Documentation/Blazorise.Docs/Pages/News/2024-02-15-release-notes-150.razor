    1. State Management
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    We've introduced a way that allows you to save and load the DataGrid state on demand using a centralized api. You can use the new <Code>LoadState</Code> and <code>GetState</code> methods to load and get the DataGrid state.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    Please find an example of how to use this feature in the <Link To="docs/extensions/datagrid/features/state-management">DataGrid State Management</Link> page.

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    Accordion dedicated components
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    We have introduced new components that are now used specifically within accordion. In the past for collapsible regions within the <Code>Accordion</Code> we used the <Code>Collapse</Code> component. This had several problems but mainly we had to internally wire to callapse what is not directly related to it. By making the collapse usage obsolete and introducing new accordion cimponent to replace it we are now much flexible and we can have more room for improvements in the future.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    The Collapse will still continue to work, but in the future you should expect it to be completelly revobed from the Accordion.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    Font Awesome icons
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    We have mapped the latest icons from Font Awesome v6 branch. This enables you to use pick from larger number of icons names in your project.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    In this version we're introducing some changes to how Font Awesome are consumed. The <Strong>Blazorise.Icons.FontAwesome</Strong> package now contains the all icons for <Strong>v5.x</Strong>, and <Strong>v6.x</Strong> FontAwesome. This change was needed because that FontAwesome doesn't have CDN for <Strong>v6.x</Strong> icons. By packaging them into Blazorise we give you a heads-up to use them. And if you want to have your own CDN you can always use it as an alternative.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    Please be aware that after we merged <Strong>FontAWesome v6.x</Strong> some icons from the <Strong>v5.x</Strong> might not work correctly. It is adwised to update CSS link to use the latest <Strong>v6.x</Strong> CSS.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    Show Tooltips on Rating
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    Now it is possible to show an extra information on the <Code>Rating</Code> component. By defining the <Code>GetTooltip</Code> callback you can show the tooltip to indicate what is the rating value that it represents.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    DropdownList
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    Added a new Parameter <Code>DisabledItem</Code>. By defining this, you can set the disabled items from the supplied data source.
