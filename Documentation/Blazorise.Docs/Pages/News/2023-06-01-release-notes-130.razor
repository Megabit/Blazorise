        <Paragraph>
            <Code>DataGrid</Code> : The data collection no longer automatically updates upon mutating the collection, for example, by using methods like <Code>Add</Code> or <Code>Remove</Code>.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
            While this feature was good to have by default, the way it was implemented, was a general performance hit on <Code>DataGrid</Code> usage, even if it wasn't in the interest of the consumer to use it.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
            As such we now recommended the following, either:
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
            <UnorderedList>
                <UnorderedListItem>Invoke <Code>gridRef.Reload();</Code> when you're done mutating your collection;</UnorderedListItem>
                <UnorderedListItem>Have your data be observable by using any implementation of the <Code>INotifyCollectionChanged</Code>, like the <Code>ObservableCollection</Code>. The example below ilustrates this.</UnorderedListItem>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    Message Provider
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    We have added localization support to the MessageProvider. This update will allow developers to create applications that can support multiple languages and locales.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    The MessageProvider is a vital component in Blazorise that enables the display of notifications, alerts, and other messages to users. With the added localization support, developers can now customize the messages displayed to users based on their preferred language and locale.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    This update will make it easier for developers to create applications that can cater to a global audience. We hope this update will be beneficial to our users and help them create more accessible and user-friendly applications.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    DataGrid
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    The <Code>DataGridSelectColumn</Code> will now enable you to provide new parameters so you can quickly render a select structure.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    We've changed the <Code>CancellableRowChange</Code> argument that's provided in the RowInserting, RowUpdating and RowRemoving callbacks and the <Code>SavedRowItem</Code> that's provided in the RowInserted, RowUpdated callbacks to now provide both an <Code>OldItem</Code> and <Code>NewItem</Code>.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    <Code>OldItem</Code> will replace the regular existing <Code>Item</Code> as it's easier to understand what it represents.
    <Code>Item</Code> is now marked as obsolete and will be removed in a future release.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    <Code>NewItem</Code> is a deep clone of the item that's being inserted or updated with the updated edit values.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    The existing <Code>Values</Code> Dictionary will still exist, but this allows you to promptly get a mapped <Code>TItem</Code> without having to write your own mapping code from the <Code>Dictionary</Code>.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    Introduced a new <Code>ApplySorting</Code> method that allows you to programatically define the columns that you'd like the grid to be sorted on.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    Please visit, <Anchor To="docs/extensions/datagrid/features/sorting">datagrid sorting docs</Anchor> for more information.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    You are now able to use pre defined filtering on a per-column basis by specifying <Code>FilterMethod</Code> on <Code>DataGridColumn</Code>.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is4">
    Expandable row groups
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    Introduced <Code>ExpandGroups</Code> and <Code>CollapseGroups</Code> methods that allows you to programatically expand or collapse specific groups.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    These new methods provide you with more control over how the data is presented and viewed, allowing you to tailor the user experience to specific usage scenarios and user preferences.

</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    Added a new <Code>ClearFilter</Code> overload. You are now able to clear the filter on specific columns.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is4">
    HeaderGroupCaption
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    We are excited to introduce the new <Strong>HeaderGroupCaption</Strong> feature for the DataGrid component. This feature allows you to group together multiple DataGrid column headers under a single, overarching caption.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    This is especially useful when you have related columns that need to be grouped under a common heading for better understanding and organization. For instance, if you have a DataGrid displaying product details, you can group columns like 'Price', 'Discount', and 'Total Cost' under a header group captioned 'Financial Details'.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    With this enhancement, you can now structure your data more effectively and provide more clarity to users. Grouping column headers using <Strong>HeaderGroupCaption</Strong> significantly improves the readability of complex grids and enhances user experience by enabling more intuitive navigation through the DataGrid.

    </UnorderedList>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    We would like to express our sincere thanks to <Anchor To="https://github.com/smfields">smfields</Anchor>, a dedicated member of our community, who initially developed this feature. <Anchor To="https://github.com/smfields">smfields</Anchor> generously granted us the rights to include it in Blazorise, enabling all users of our library to benefit from this versatile component.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    We look forward to seeing the creative ways in which you'll incorporate this new feature into your projects!
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    Video
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    In this release, we've added a significant enhancement to the <Anchor To="docs/extensions/video">Blazorise Video player</Anchor>. Users now have the ability to define multiple sources for a single video, each with different qualities. This includes options for 576p, 720p, and 1080p. The chosen video file, hosted at a unique URL for each quality, will load based on the user's preference or network conditions. By default, the player is set to display the video in 720p. This new feature offers users a more tailored and efficient video viewing experience by adapting to their specific needs and conditions.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    Dropdown
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    We've migrated the underlying library that takes care of dynamically "anchor position" the dropdown menu according to the UI constraints. It has been migrated from <Anchor To="https://popper.js.org/">Popper</Anchor> to the newer <Anchor To="https://floating-ui.com/">Floating UI</Anchor> library.
    Behaviour should remain unchanged and your dropdown menus should still be cleverly positioned!
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    Added a new <Code>PositionStrategy</Code> parameter, that allows you to set the positioning strategy for your dropdown. Please read <Anchor To="https://floating-ui.com/docs/computeposition#strategy">Floating UI Strategy</Anchor> for more details on how it can affect the positioning of your dropdown.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    Fixed an issue where in some certain cases, if buttons existed inside the Dropdown the menu positioning would not be handled correctly.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    Validation
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    We've added support for <Strong>IValidatableObject</Strong>. This new feature enhances the flexibility and robustness of your form validation processes. By implementing the <Strong>IValidatableObject</Strong> interface in your models, you can now provide custom validation logic that is more complex and situation-specific than what can be achieved with simple data annotation validation. This interface includes the <Strong>Validate</Strong> method, which you can override to define your custom validation rules. This method is automatically invoked when performing model validation, ensuring that your custom rules are adhered to. This feature is useful when the validity of a property's value is dependent on another property's value, or when an intricate validation process is required.
