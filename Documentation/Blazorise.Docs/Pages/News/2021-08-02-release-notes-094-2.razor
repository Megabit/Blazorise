<Paragraph>
    This patch release brings more bug fixes than usual. Which makes sense considering how many changes we introduced with v0.9.4 release.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    The most nasty bug was with the DataGrid edit mode where it would raise an exception if you had any nested field as a complex object. But David was quick to investigate and issue a fix along with more unit tests so that it doesn't repeat in the future.

<Paragraph>
    In any case, Blazorise should be much stable now so just grab new NuGets and update your projects 💪
