    Maintenance release: Blazorise 1.6.1
</NewsPageTitle>

<Paragraph>
    One month ago we have released Blazorise 1.6 which came with many new features and improvements. Today we are pleased to announce the release of version 1.6.1, which includes important bug fixes and enhancements. This release focuses on improving stability and addressing key issues identified by our user community. We are grateful for the feedback and contributions that have helped us make Blazorise better with each update.

    Major Improvements in 1.6.1
</NewsPageSubtitle>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    FileEdit Button Text
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    Fixed an issue where the FileEdit button text displayed the selected file name after selection. The fix was present only on Bootstrap 5, and the issue was fixed by changing the HTML structure of the FileEdit component. The button text now correctly displays the selected file name after selection.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    Datagrid Detail Row Click
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    Addressed the issue of disabling row clicks on the DataGrid's multi-selection checkbox. The solution involves using <Code>ClickStopPropagation</Code> to prevent click events from propagating when clicking near the checkbox. When the checkbox is actually clicked, the <Code>OnMultiSelectCheckClicked</Code> event is used to manually invoke <Code>HandleClick</Code>. To maintain the necessary functionality, a <Code>multiSelectPreventRowClick</Code> option was added to prevent triggering the DetailRow, while allowing other actions to continue as expected.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    Autocomplete with Cropper
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    Resolved issues with <Code>Autocomplete</Code> when used alongside Cropper. The problem was that cropper events were not properly disposed of, leading to conflicts with input elements that were listening for <Code>+</Code> and <Code>-</Code> keys. We have reported the issue to the Cropper team, who then fixed it. The Blazorise was subsequently updated to incorporate this fix.
</Paragraph>

<NewsPageSubtitle>
    Additional Improvements
</NewsPageSubtitle>

<Paragraph>
    Along with the major fixes, we have addressed several other bugs and made minor improvements to enhance the overall user experience and functionality of Blazorise. We appreciate your patience and continuous support as we work to make Blazorise better with each update.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    We encourage you to update to version 1.6.1 to benefit from these fixes and improvements. As always, please report any issues or provide feedback to help us continue improving.
