    New Features & Enhancements 🚀
</NewsPageSubtitle>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    Official .NET 8 Support
</Heading>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    DatePicker input mask
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    With the feedback from our community, we've introduced a new <Code>InputFormat</Code> parameter for the input mask. This feature lets developers define the format that the input should adhere to, ensuring consistency and data integrity.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    At this moment almost all date formats should be supported. The only feature that is still missing is the usage of long-name days and month, eg <Code>ddd.MM.yyyy</Code>, or <Code>dd.MMM.yyyy</Code>. We are working on making it work in future versions.
</Paragraph>

<NewsPageSubtitle>
    DataGrid
</NewsPageSubtitle>

<Paragraph>
    With the introduction of the new <Code>DataGridFilterMode.Menu</Code> feature, we've found out that although it was an appreciated feature, users wanted even more contextual filtering support, i.e: numeric columns, with inbuilt 'less than'' or 'greater than' filtering method support.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    We've now changed the <Code>DataGridColumn</Code> <Code>FilterMethod</Code> to be a specialized and contextual enum named <Code>DataGridColumnFilterMethod</Code> that enables additional filtering capabilities for numeric and date columns.
</Paragraph>

<UnorderedList>
    <UnorderedListItem>LessThan</UnorderedListItem>
    <UnorderedListItem>LessThanOrEqual</UnorderedListItem>
    <UnorderedListItem>GreaterThan</UnorderedListItem>
    <UnorderedListItem>GreaterThanOrEqual</UnorderedListItem>
</UnorderedList>

<Paragraph>
    If you're using the <Code>DataGridFilterMode.Menu</Code> feature, your date and numeric columns will now present the new filtering capabilities.
    Otherwise, you may also set the new filtering capabilities on your regular columns, but please take note that these will only work if the columns are of a numeric or date type.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    Introduced a new <Code>HelpText</Code> Parameter in the <Code>DataGridColumn</Code> that will render an help text below the column field input when editing.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    Introduced a new <Code>DataGridEditMode</Code> option, named Cell, this allows he user to edit the cell value directly, very much like an excel file behaves.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    Every DataGrid edit related feature should still work as expected, like validations, etc.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    For an experience similar to excel, we recommend using the <Code>Cell</Code> edit mode with the <Code>DataGridCommandColumn</Code> configured as <Code>EditCommandAllowed="false" DeleteCommandAllowed="false"</Code>. Additionally you might even set the <Code>SaveCommandAllowed="false" CancelCommandAllowed="false"</Code>, and use the Enter and Escape keys to Save and Cancel respectively.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    It is of note that <Code>Tab </Code> and <Code>Shift+Tab</Code> will also work as expected. Whenever the user presses these keys, the cell will be saved and the next or previous cell will be selected.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    The <Code>FilterMode</Code> is now configurable per column. If set it will override the DataGrid's <Code>FilterMode</Code> setting per column.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    We've introduced the ability to batch changes by enabling the new DataGrid Parameter <Code>BatchEdit</Code>. This will allow the user to edit multiple rows and then save all the changes at once.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    We've introduced the following new Parameters to further customize your DataGrid rows and cells.
    <UnorderedList>
        <UnorderedListItem><Code>RowBatchEditStyling</Code></UnorderedListItem>
        <UnorderedListItem><Code>CellStyling</Code></UnorderedListItem>
        <UnorderedListItem><Code>CellSelectedStyling</Code></UnorderedListItem>
        <UnorderedListItem><Code>CellBatchEditStyling</Code></UnorderedListItem>
    </UnorderedList>
    With the introduction of these more general parameters, the <Code>DataGridColumn</Code> parameters <Code>CellClass</Code> and <Code>CellStyle</Code> are deemed as obsolete and will be removed in a future version.
</Paragraph>

<NewsPageSubtitle>
    Tabs
</NewsPageSubtitle>

<Paragraph>
    The <Code>TabsContent</Code> component now also supports the <Code>RenderMode</Code> feature. This is specially useful when you need to use the <Code>Tabs</Code> and <Code>TabsContent</Code> separately, since these are unable to communicate, you can now set the <Code>RenderMode</Code> in the <Code>TabsContent</Code>.
</Paragraph>


<NewsPageSubtitle>
