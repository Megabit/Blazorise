<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    Extended Color Variants
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    In modern web design, color is more than just a visual accent, it's a vital part of hierarchy, accessibility, and user experience. Contemporary design systems use multiple shades and tones to convey meaning and create visual depth. To align with this practice, Blazorise 1.9 introduces full support for <Strong>extended color variants</Strong> within its utility classes.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    Enumerations such as <Code>Background</Code> and <Code>TextColor</Code> now support <Strong>nested color variants</Strong>, offering finer control over tone and emphasis. Previously, developers could only use base color values like <Code>Background.Success</Code> or <Code>TextColor.Danger</Code>. With extended variants, you can now specify nuanced options like <Code>Background.Success.Subtle</Code> or <Code>TextColor.Success.Emphasis</Code>, bringing Blazorise utilities in line with modern frameworks such as Bootstrap 5.3 and Fluent.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    This capability is powered by the new <Code>IEnumerationNameBuilder</Code> infrastructure, which standardizes how enumeration names are translated into CSS class names. For example, the Bootstrap provider automatically maps values to classes like <Code>bg-success-subtle</Code> or <Code>text-success-emphasis</Code>. The feature is fully backward compatible, ensuring that existing components and markup continue to work seamlessly across all supported Blazorise providers.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    FluentUI Theme Generator
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    For the first time, Blazorise now includes a built-in theme generator for FluentUI. This allows developers to easily create and customize themes that align with Microsoft's Fluent Design System, enhancing the visual consistency of applications built with Blazorise.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    We tried to keep the theme as close to the original FluentUI design as possible, while also allowing for customization to fit your application's needs. The theme generator provides a straightforward way to apply FluentUI styles across all Blazorise components, ensuring a cohesive look and feel.
