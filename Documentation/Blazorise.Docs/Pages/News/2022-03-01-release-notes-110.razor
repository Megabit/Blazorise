<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    Focus Trap
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    As a continuous work to improve AODA compatibility we have created a new FocusTrap component. TrapFocus is a component that manages focus for its descendants. This is useful when implementing overlays such as modal dialogs, which should not allow the focus to escape while open.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    The new component is already part of the <Code>Modal</Code> which can be controlled by setting the <Code>FocusTrap</Code> parameter. If you wish to use new component on its own then you can look at the example on the <Anchor To="docs/components/focus-trap">FocusTrap page</Anchor>.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    Highlighter
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    This is a relatively small component, but it can be beneficial when designing the UI for your application. For example, it helps you visually distinguish parts of the text by highlighting them based on the search term.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    DataGrid
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    Added <Code>ShowDefaultSortIcon</Code> parameter to <Code>DataGrid</Code>. By enabling this parameter, a default sort icon will now display.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    Introduced <Code>PagerOptions</Code> with the following options:
    <UnorderedList>
        <UnorderedListItem><Strong>Size</Strong> : Configures the pager buttons size.</UnorderedListItem>
        <UnorderedListItem><Strong>ButtonRowPosition</Strong> : Configures the button row position.</UnorderedListItem>
        <UnorderedListItem><Strong>PaginationPosition</Strong> : Configures the pagination position.</UnorderedListItem>
        <UnorderedListItem><Strong>TotalItemsPosition</Strong> : Configures the total items position.</UnorderedListItem>
    </UnorderedList>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    Added <Code>ScrollRowOnEdit</Code> parameter to <Code>DataGrid</Code> <Code>VirtualizeOptions</Code>. When <Code>Virtualize</Code> is set, you may now disable the behaviour of scrolling the row to the top on edit when on <Code>DataGridEditMode.Inline</Code> or <Code>DataGridEditMode.Form</Code> by setting this new option to false.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    Added <Code>SelectedRowIndex</Code> getter to <Code>DataGrid</Code>. This is an helper so you can quickly find the Zero-based index of your <Code>SelectedRow</Code>. It can be an useful API in conjuction with the <Code>ScrollToRow</Code> method, that takes in a Zero-based index of <Code>DataGrid</Code> row to scroll to.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    Added <Code>SortOrder</Code> parameter to <Code>DataGrid</Code> so when the <Code>DataGrid</Code> sorting mechanism is set to multiple, you are able to configure the order of which the sorting of the columns takes place, this is specially useful, if you want to start the <Code>DataGrid</Code> sorted a certain way.
    Please do take note, that for the parameter to listen to changes and be able to dynamically be adjusted to the <Code>DataGrid</Code> changes, you should use <Code>bind-SortOrder</Code>.
    An example is when you have a Column A with a <Code>SortOrder</Code> of 2 And Column B with a <Code>SortOrder</Code> of 1, the moment the user removes the sorting out of Column B, the <Code>DataGrid</Code> will attempt to reset the <Code>SortOrder</Code> back to 0 as to accomodate the natural multiple sorting rules.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    ModalProvider
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    Introduced a new component <Code>ModalProvider</Code>. You are now able to programatically decide what custom content or component you want to instantiate inside of your Modal, even with the support of parameters.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    Autocomplete
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    Introduced <Code>ReadData</Code> support enabling you to provide that to Autocomplete on demand according to the user's searched text.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    Introduced <Code>ConfirmKey</Code> parameter, you are now able to costumize the keyboard keys that should be considered as a Confirmation Key.
    Take note :
    If the value has a printed representation, this attribute's value is the same as the char attribute.
    Otherwise, it's one of the key value strings specified in 'Key values'.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    Introduced <Code>AutoSelectFirstItem</Code>, this defaults to true, keeping the current behaviour. By setting it to false, the dropdown that shows the options, will no longer auto select the first item.
    This is specially useful for a use case reported by our users.
    When you have the <Code>AutoComplete</Code> set to <Code>Multiple</Code> + <Code>FreeTyping</Code>, and want to allow your user to just press the Confirm Key to accept the currently typed text.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    ListView
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    Introduced <Code>ItemTemplate</Code> Parameter, you may now costumize the content that renders in each of the <Code>ListView</Code>'s items.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    Introduced a much needed missing <Code>ValueField</Code> Parameter, so you may uniquely identify each item in your list. 
    This has been introduced with a return value of <Code>String</Code> for now. However we plan to make it return a generic type <Code>TValue</Code> in a future version, much like some of our other <Code>ValueField</Code> based components, so you can choose what type does your unique value return.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    Other improvements
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    All our <Code>Clicked</Code> parameters on a <Code Tag>Button</Code>, <Code Tag>Link</Code>, <Code Tag>Tab</Code>, and other components, can now recieve a <Code>MouseEventArgs</Code> as an event parameter. This feature will allow you to determine how the clicked event was raised and what buttons and keys were pressed.
