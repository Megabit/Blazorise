            Added a new <Code>DropdownMenuTargetId</Code> parameter, that allows you to set a custom anchor element id for the dropdown menu. This is useful when you want the dropdown menu to be anchored from a different element than the toggle button.

    Validation with IValidatableObject
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    We've added support for <Strong>IValidatableObject</Strong>. This new feature enhances the flexibility and robustness of your form validation processes. By implementing the <Strong>IValidatableObject</Strong> interface in your models, you can now provide custom validation logic that is more complex and situation-specific than what can be achieved with simple data annotation validation.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    This interface includes the <Strong>Validate</Strong> method, which you can override to define your custom validation rules. This method is automatically invoked when performing model validation, ensuring that your custom rules are adhered to. This feature is useful when the validity of a property's value is dependent on another property's value, or when an intricate validation process is required.

<Paragraph>
    The <Anchor To="docs/helpers/utilities/css-grid" Title="Link to CSS Grid">CSS Grid</Anchor> is a two-dimensional layout model, comprised of 12 columns and up to 6 rows, providing a robust structure for building complex layouts. This structure allows developers to craft visually appealing and responsive designs that will adapt seamlessly across various devices and screen sizes.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    One of the standout features is its built-in responsiveness with mobile breakpoints. This ensures that the layout will automatically adjust to provide an optimal viewing experience on different devices, from large desktop monitors down to mobile phones. The alignment and positioning within the grid have been carefully designed to offer a straightforward yet powerful way to arrange your components.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    We believe this new grid system will offer our developers more control and creativity in crafting layouts, making it easier to produce stunning, responsive designs. We encourage you to explore this new feature and as always, your feedback is most welcome.

    Lists Style Image

<NewsPageImageModal ImageSource="img/news/130/feature-liststyle.png" ImageTitle="Feature Lists Style Image" />

<Paragraph>
    The ListStyleImage parameter allows you to define the marker images for list items. This gives you more flexibility and creativity in styling your lists, enhancing your user interface by going beyond the traditional bullet points or numerical markers. You can now use custom images to highlight or differentiate individual list items. It takes a string as its value, which should be <Strong>Base64</Strong> encoded string that represents an image, or a <Strong>URL</Strong> of the image you wish to use as your list marker. Please note that the image URL must be enclosed in url() and the image should ideally be a small, suitable size for use as a list marker. The example can be found on <Anchor To="docs/components/typography">Typography</Anchor> pages.
