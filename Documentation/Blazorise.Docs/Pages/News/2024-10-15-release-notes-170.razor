<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    Autocomplete
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    There was a limitation where the Autocomplete would not handle Texts that were repeated correctly. The Autocomplete should now allow you to have repeated Texts, it is of note that the values should still be unique and it should work as expected.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    Datagrid
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    Added <Code>SelectedCell</Code> and <Code>SelectedCellChanged</Code> parameters, you can now listen to the cell selection changes when the <Code>Datagrid.NavigationMode</Code> is set to <Code>NavigationMode.Cell</Code>
</Paragraph>


<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    Optimizations
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    We made many optimization internally to make Blazorise more easier for customizations. This changes are not easily visible unless you plan to implement your own CSS provider, or your custom design system.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    So, what did we do. We have changed the signatures of many of IClassProvider methods to make them accept extra attribites. This allows for more customization since now every CSS provider can decide for itsels how it will assign the classname, and how it will render.
