<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">

</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    As part of our ongoing efforts to improve and enhance the functionality of Blazorise, we are excited to announce the release of a new <Link To="https://tailwindcss.com/" Title="Tailwind CSS">Tailwind CSS</Link> provider for Blazorise, which was created on top of <Link To="https://flowbite.com/" Title="Link to Flowbite">Flowbite</Link> with the courtesy of their creators.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    For those unfamiliar with Tailwind CSS, it is a utility-first CSS framework that allows developers to easily style their applications by providing a wide range of pre-designed classes that can be applied directly to HTML elements. It is a popular choice for many developers because of its simplicity and flexibility.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    With the new Tailwind CSS provider for Blazorise, you can easily apply Tailwind styles to your Blazor components and take advantage of all the benefits that Tailwind has to offer. This provider is fully integrated with Blazorise and allows you to use all the features of Blazorise while still benefiting from the power of Tailwind.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    To get started with the new Tailwind CSS provider, simply install the latest version of Blazorise and add the Tailwind CSS provider to your project by following our <Link To="docs/usage/tailwind" Title="Link to Tailwind Guide">startup guide</Link>.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    We would like to extend a special thank you to the creators of <Link To="https://flowbite.com/" Title="Link to Flowbite">Flowbite</Link> for their contribution in making this provider possible.

<NewsPageImageModal ImageSource="img/news/120/feature-datalabels.png" ImageTitle="Feature Image Chart DataLabels component" />

<Paragraph>
    The Chart DataLabels is a new feature that provides users with the ability to display data values for each data point in a chart. The Blazorise Chart DataLabels can be customized to suit individual needs, with options for font size, color, and position, allowing for a high degree of flexibility and control.

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    LottieAnimation extension
</Heading>

<NewsPageImageModal ImageSource="img/news/120/feature-lottie.png" ImageTitle="Feature Lottie component" />

<Paragraph>
    The LottieAnimation component allows you to easily incorporate beautiful, customizable animations into your Blazor applications using the <Link To="https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-web">Lottie</Link> Javascript library. The library's purpose is to allow applications to directly render animations exported from Adobe After Effects without needing to recreate the animation by hand in the HTML. It is simple to use and provides a seamless integration with Blazorise.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    We are grateful to <Link To="https://github.com/smfields">smfields</Link> for their contribution to the Blazorise community and for bringing this exciting new feature to our users.
</Paragraph>

</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    Cropper Component
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    When building an application, best practice requires reducing an image's surrounding noise and directing a user's attention to a specific part of the image. Image cropping is a method for manipulating images to remove any unwanted elements. By changing the aspect ratio or orientation, we can draw viewers' eyes to the photograph's primary subject and improve the overall composition. This applies to profile pictures or uploading images with specific dimensions.
</Paragraph>

<NewsPageImageModal ImageSource="img/news/120/feature-cropper.png" ImageTitle="Feature Cropper component" />

<Paragraph>
    The new <Code>Cropper</Code> component handles all of that. You can now upload an image and then select part of it, rotate, scale, and crop it. You can also add a preview by adding a <Code>CropperViewer</Code> whenever on a page, and it will automatically synchronize with the latest selection.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    As with many other components, the Cropper component is also created with the help of our community member <Link To="https://github.com/njannink">njannink</Link>. We will need to send him a larger MVC award gift next year 😊.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    The usage of new cropper component can be see on <Anchor To="docs/extensions/cropper">Cropper page</Anchor>.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    Gap Utility
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    Blazorise Gap Utility is a new feature that provides users with the ability to create gaps between elements in a responsive and flexible manner. This utility allows developers to easily manage spacing between elements and to ensure consistency in their layouts. With the Blazorise Gap Utility, users can control the size and behavior of gaps between elements with ease, making it simple to create beautiful, responsive designs.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    Typography Lead component
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    This component allows users to easily apply a larger, bolder font style to important text on their web pages, making it stand out and draw the reader's attention.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    This new component can be used to wrap any text element, and includes customization options for font size, font weight, and text color.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    AccordionToggle component
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    We have introduced a new AccordionToggle component that should be used instead of the Button component when building an Accordion.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    The Button component is no longer recommended for use inside an Accordion and may cause unexpected behavior. Using the AccordionToggle component will ensure that your Accordion functions as intended.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    To update your code, simply replace any instances of <Code Tag>Button</Code> inside your Accordion with <Code Tag>AccordionToggle</Code>.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    TreeView improvements
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    The TreeView component now supports a multiple selection mode, which allows users to select multiple nodes at the same time. To enable this mode, set the <Code>SelectionMode</Code> property to <Code>Multiple</Code>. When this mode is enabled, each node in the TreeView will display a checkbox next to its label. Users can then select or deselect nodes by clicking on the checkboxes. The selected nodes can be accessed through the <Code>SelectedNodes</Code> property, which returns a list of the selected nodes. You can also use the <Code>SelectedNodesChanged</Code> event to be notified when the selection changes.
</Paragraph>

<NewsPageImageModal ImageSource="img/news/120/feature-treeview.png" ImageTitle="Feature TreeView component" />

<Paragraph>
    Several new APIs for the Blazorise TreeView component have also included in this release! These APIs include:
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    <UnorderedList>
        <UnorderedListItem>
            <Code>GetChildNodesAsync</Code>: allows you to retrieve the child nodes of a specific node asynchronously.
        </UnorderedListItem>
        <UnorderedListItem>
            <Code>HasChildNodesAsync</Code>: allows you to check if a specific node has child nodes asynchronously.
        </UnorderedListItem>
        <UnorderedListItem>
            <Code>ExpandAll</Code>: expands all nodes in the tree.
        </UnorderedListItem>
        <UnorderedListItem>
            <Code>CollapseAll</Code>: collapses all nodes in the tree.
        </UnorderedListItem>
    </UnorderedList>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    In addition to these new APIs, we've also added a new feature called <Code>AutoExpandAll</Code>. This feature will automatically expand all nodes in the tree on the first load only.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    We hope this new features will make it easier for users to work with the TreeView component.

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is4">
    Highlight search
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    Blazorise Autocomplete now includes a search highlight feature that allows users to easily locate items in the dropdown list. When a search value is entered, the matching items in the dropdown will be highlighted, making it easier to find and select the desired item. This feature is particularly useful when working with large lists of items and helps improve the overall user experience.
</Paragraph>

<NewsPageImageModal ImageSource="img/news/120/feature-autocomplete.png" ImageTitle="Feature Autocomplete Highlight" />

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is4">
    Virtualize mode
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    The <Code>Virtualize</Code> feature allows for loading data on demand while scrolling, which greatly improves the performance of the component when working with large datasets.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    With <Code>Virtualize</Code>, the Autocomplete component only loads the items that are currently visible in the list, and as the user scrolls, more items are loaded in the background. This allows for a much faster and smoother user experience, especially when working with large lists of items.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    To use the Virtualize feature, simply set the <Code>Virtualize</Code> property to <Code>"true"</Code> on the Autocomplete component.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    DataGrid

<Paragraph>
    The new grouping feature for <Link To="docs/extensions/datagrid">Blazorise DataGrid</Link> allows you to easily group and organize your data by specific columns. This can be useful for analyzing large sets of data and finding patterns or trends.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    <UnorderedList>
        <UnorderedListItem>
            The <Code>Groupable</Code> and <Code>Grouping</Code> parameters allow you to specify which columns can be grouped and which should be used for grouping. You can also provide a custom <Code>GroupBy</Code> function to define how the data should be grouped.
        </UnorderedListItem>
        <UnorderedListItem>
            The <Code>ShowGrouping</Code> on DataGrid feature allows you to drag and drop groupable columns onto a designated group area, making it easy to rearrange and experiment with different groupings. This feature is helpful for creating ad-hoc analysis and reporting.
        </UnorderedListItem>
    </UnorderedList>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    Overall, this new grouping feature provides more flexibility and control over how you organize and analyze your data within the Blazorise DataGrid.

</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is4">
    New PageSelectorTemplate & PageSizesTemplate
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    The new Blazorise DataGrid features include a PageSelectorTemplate and PageSizesTemplate. The PageSelectorTemplate allows users to customize the look and feel of the page selector, while the PageSizesTemplate allows users to customize the options for the number of items per page. These new templates provide increased flexibility and customization for the DataGrid, allowing developers to tailor the user experience to their specific needs.

    New Licensing System
</NewsPageSubtitle>

<Paragraph>
    We are pleased to announce a new licensing system for Blazorise 1.2, designed to enhance the security of your Blazor applications. To begin using the new system, simply log in to your account on the Blazorise website and generate your unique <Strong>Product Token</Strong>. Once generated, you will need to define this token in your Blazor application during startup.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    Please be advised that, at present, the ability to generate the product token is only available to our commercial users. However, we are working diligently to make this feature accessible to all users in the near future.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    We want to assure you that the new licensing system will have no impact on the features and functionality of Blazorise. The only difference you may notice is a "free license message" printed in the console.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    We believe that the new licensing system will provide a more secure and efficient experience for our users. If you have any questions or require assistance, please do not hesitate to contact us.
