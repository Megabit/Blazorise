</NewsPageTitle>

<Paragraph>
    It’s been a while since our last stable release! And this is not the long anticipated 1.3, nor 2.0, but simply a <Strong>Blazorise 1.2.2</Strong> maintenance release to fix a handful of issues in the current 1.2 stable branch.

    But don’t worry – the feature release 1.3 is going forward as planned.

    Blazorise, an open-source component library, is maintained by Megabit Ltd, a small organization based in Croatia. We are strong advocates of the open-source ecosystem, which is why we offer Blazorise through our Community licenses at no cost. However, if you are part of a large organization and would like to support the project, we suggest purchasing a commercial license to help us maintain a sustainable business. This will enable us to continue developing Blazorise.
