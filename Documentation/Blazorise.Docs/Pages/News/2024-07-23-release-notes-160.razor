    Video Component - update to new library
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    We have updated our <Anchor To="docs/extensions/video">Video extension component</Anchor> to work with the new <Anchor To="https://www.vidstack.io/">VidStack</Anchor> library. Previously, we were utilizing the <Anchor To="https://plyr.io/">Plyr</Anchor> library for our video playback needs. However, over time, Plyr has gradually been replaced by the newer and more advanced VidStack library.
</Paragraph>

<NewsPageImageModal ImageSource="img/news/160/video.png" ImageTitle="Feature Video Component" />

<Paragraph>
    The decision to transition to VidStack was driven by several compelling reasons. First and foremost, VidStack offers a host of new features that were not available in Plyr. These features enhance the overall user experience by providing more robust and versatile functionality. Additionally, VidStack is significantly more stable, which means fewer bugs and crashes, leading to a smoother and more reliable performance.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    Moreover, the VidStack library is designed with modern web development practices in mind, making it easier to integrate and maintain. It supports the latest web technologies and standards, ensuring that our video extension component remains up-to-date and compatible with future advancements.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    Given these advantages, we felt it was essential to update our component to take full advantage of what VidStack has to offer. Our team has worked diligently to implement these new features and ensure that the transition from Plyr to VidStack is as seamless as possible for our users. We are confident that this update will provide a superior video playback experience and look forward to the benefits it will bring.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    In addition to leveraging the core improvements of VidStack, we have also added a few small but impactful features to our component:
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    <UnorderedList>
        <UnorderedListItem>
            <Paragraph>
                <Strong>Thumbnails:</Strong> You can now specify URLs for video thumbnails, enhancing the visual preview of the video content.
            </Paragraph>
        </UnorderedListItem>
        <UnorderedListItem>
            <Paragraph>
                <Strong>ProtectionServerCertificateUrl:</Strong> For HLS (HTTP Live Streaming) content, we have added support for specifying the Protection Server Certificate URL, improving the security and integrity of video streams.
            </Paragraph>
        </UnorderedListItem>
    </UnorderedList>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    We are confident that these updates will provide a superior video playback experience and look forward to the benefits they will bring.

    DataGrid Improvements
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    The Blazorise DataGrid has received a multitude of new improvements in this update, significantly enhancing its functionality and user experience.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is4">
    1. New Mobile Responsive Mode
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    With the introduction of the new <Strong>ResponsiveMode</Strong> parameter in the underlying <Anchor To="docs/components/table">Table component</Anchor>, the DataGrid now supports <Strong>TableResponsiveMode.Mobile</Strong>. This mode renders a dedicated layout for mobile devices, where the columns are stacked on top of each other for better readability and usability on smaller screens.
</Paragraph>

<NewsPageImageModal ImageSource="img/news/160/mobile-mode.png" ImageTitle="Feature Mobile Responsive Mode" />

<Paragraph>
    Please note that in this mode, the DataGrid may have limited functionality. Features such as caption templates, fixed headers, resizing, and others might not be compatible. This feature is highly opinionated, meaning it enforces a specific design philosophy aimed at optimizing mobile experience.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    We consider this feature experimental and are actively seeking feedback to improve it further.
</Paragraph>

    Enhancements have been made to the filtering components of the Blazorise DataGrid, providing more contextual and relevant filtering options based on the column types you have specified.

</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is4">

</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    With dynamic data binding, the DataGrid can now seamlessly bind to dynamic data sources, providing a more flexible and efficient way to handle data. Additionally, this feature includes support for <Strong>ExpandoObject</Strong>, enabling the DataGrid to work with dynamic objects that can have their properties added or removed at runtime.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    This new capability enhances the usability of the DataGrid, particularly in scenarios where data structures are not known at compile time or can change dynamically.
