    Key Highlights in 1.7.5
</NewsPageSubtitle>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    Improved Markdown File Upload Handling
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    Managing uploaded files in the <Anchor To="docs/extensions/markdown" Title="Link to Markdown component">Markdown component</Anchor> is now more efficient. With the newly merged uploaded files callback, developers can seamlessly process multiple file uploads without unnecessary complexities. This change enhances the Markdown editing experience by reducing errors and improving user workflow.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3">
    Better DataGrid Cell Editing Behavior
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    A long-standing issue in the <Anchor To="docs/extensions/datagrid/features/editing" Title="Link to DataGrid">DataGrid</Anchor> where cancelling a cell edit would not restore focus has been fixed. Now, when a user cancels an edit, the focus properly returns to the relevant cell, ensuring a more intuitive and user-friendly interaction.
</Paragraph>

<NewsPageSubtitle>
    Fix for Video Component Seeking Event
</NewsPageSubtitle>

<Paragraph>
    The Seeking event in the <Anchor To="docs/extensions/video" Title="Link to Video component">Video component</Anchor> was previously unreliable, leading to issues when users attempted to scrub through video content. This has been fixed, allowing seamless seeking behavior and better control over video playback.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    We encourage you to update to version 1.7.5 to benefit from these fixes and improvements. As always, please report any issues or provide feedback to help us continue improving.
