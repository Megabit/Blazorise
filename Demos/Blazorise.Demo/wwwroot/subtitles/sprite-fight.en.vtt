00:00:17.375 --> 00:00:19.458
Hello, Mr.Snail!

00:00:19.458 --> 00:00:22.333
Aw, you cute little cornu aspersum.

00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:25.125
Latin name bonus-points!

00:00:28.375 --> 00:00:30.833
Can’t believe we got stuck with the tree hugger.

00:00:30.833 --> 00:00:34.667
If I have to hear the latin name for one more animal, I swear I'm gonna kill her.

00:00:34.667 --> 00:00:39.542
Relax, Sugar Buns. While she does all the work we’ll have all the fun.

00:00:39.542 --> 00:00:42.583
Yeah! And get wasted out of our minds!

00:00:42.583 --> 00:00:44.250
Way ahead of you, man.

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.625
C’mon, team! We mustn’t dilly-dally when there’s so much nature to see!

00:00:48.625 --> 00:00:53.667
I was thinking we should call our class project, “Fungis in a Forest!”

00:00:53.667 --> 00:00:56.167
Get it? Because we’re a group of fun guys.

00:00:56.167 --> 00:00:57.667
And also fungis which-

00:00:57.667 --> 00:01:02.458
Shush! That’s a yellow wagtail. And she’s in distress!

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.333
There, there, my little motacilla flava.

00:01:07.792 --> 00:01:10.042
Oh! Look at her go!

00:01:10.375 --> 00:01:11.500
Wow!

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.417
Out of the way, dorkwad! We're camping here.

00:01:14.417 --> 00:01:17.500
Finally! Time to get that BBQ burning.

00:01:18.417 --> 00:01:20.167
Oh. Oh, dear.

00:01:27.333 --> 00:01:28.875
Gross!

00:01:30.833 --> 00:01:35.458
Oh. Easy, guys. We’re supposed to be studying nature, not wrecking it.

00:01:35.458 --> 00:01:37.958
Piss break!

00:01:40.708 --> 00:01:44.667
Oy, fungus freak! Make yourself useful and fix the tent.

00:01:44.667 --> 00:01:48.917
Oh, a bit of friendly campsite ribbing. Fun.

00:01:49.875 --> 00:01:52.583
She wouldn't survive 5 minutes alone in these woods.

00:01:52.583 --> 00:01:56.792
Yeah. She's a real weenie that one, innit?

00:01:56.792 --> 00:01:59.000
Oy, Phil! How those sausages coming?

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.458
Almost ready! Just need a bit more salt...

00:02:36.333 --> 00:02:39.208
It's incredible. It's a new species.

00:02:39.208 --> 00:02:41.875
What the bloody hell are those things?

00:02:41.875 --> 00:02:44.542
It's like a gnome shagged a mushroom.

00:02:57.375 --> 00:02:59.583
They’re absolutely adorable.

00:02:59.583 --> 00:03:02.000
Yeah, absolutely bloody adorable.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.625
And I bet we’ll make a fortune if we catch one of those things.

00:03:05.625 --> 00:03:06.958
We'd be famous!

00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:08.292
Get on MTV.

00:03:08.292 --> 00:03:09.875
I wonder what they taste like.

00:03:09.875 --> 00:03:12.500
We really shouldn't disrupt their habitat.

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.917
Right. Sure, sure.

00:03:15.917 --> 00:03:17.500
Greetings.

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.000
Welcome, friends.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.208
I'll be right down.

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.750
Could I interest you in some peppermint tea?

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.667
What are you guys?

00:03:30.667 --> 00:03:34.417
We are Sprites. We sprite balance to the forest.

00:03:34.417 --> 00:03:39.667
We take care of the animals, plants, birds, moss...

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.917
Guys? Guys, I...

00:03:46.583 --> 00:03:51.542
Hey, uh, little mushroom geezer, you cool with us camping here for the night?

00:03:51.542 --> 00:03:56.333
Absolutely. A friend of the forest is a friend of the sprites.

00:03:57.708 --> 00:04:01.375
Maybe it was just ketchup... or something... like...

00:04:01.375 --> 00:04:09.125
Red paint? Yeah, maybe they were just painting their little hats or... something...

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.042
Guys?

00:04:20.083 --> 00:04:21.625
Guys?

00:04:22.417 --> 00:04:23.958
Guys, this isn't funny.

00:04:25.083 --> 00:04:26.625
Guys?

00:04:47.208 --> 00:04:50.167
We were just gonna catch one! But they’re psycho!

00:04:50.167 --> 00:04:52.958
You gotta get me outta these! Hurry! They’re gonna kill us!

00:04:55.667 --> 00:04:56.583
Hurry!

00:04:56.583 --> 00:04:59.458
Right foot, left foot, leaf and stone.

00:04:59.458 --> 00:05:03.583
You picked the wrong camping spot, bitches.

00:05:03.583 --> 00:05:05.292
Sprite them!

00:05:05.833 --> 00:05:07.542
Run!!!

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:20.091
Take that, you little freaks!

00:05:21.567 --> 00:05:22.286
Sprite this! 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:32.083
Aaaah! My eyes!

00:05:57.625 --> 00:05:59.625
Sugar Buns?! Help me!

00:06:07.125 --> 00:06:08.875
Sweet cakes!

00:06:11.292 --> 00:06:13.208
Love muffin...

00:06:14.167 --> 00:06:15.667
Huh?

00:06:40.042 --> 00:06:43.458
No, no, no! I can’t swim!

00:06:55.083 --> 00:06:56.875
Yes!

00:06:58.292 --> 00:06:59.708
No!

00:07:06.359 --> 00:07:08.141
Son of a Spriteberry!

00:07:08.141 --> 00:07:09.608
It burns! It burns! 

00:07:12.833 --> 00:07:16.208
I don’t want to hurt you! Just keep your distance!

00:07:17.208 --> 00:07:21.125
All right, then. Eat salt, you little green bastards!

00:07:56.833 --> 00:07:58.542
Nuh-uh-uh.

00:07:58.542 --> 00:08:03.333
Those punks treated the world as their own personal rubbish bin.

00:08:03.333 --> 00:08:05.625
And you set them free!

00:08:05.625 --> 00:08:07.833
Now you'll join them!

00:08:45.875 --> 00:08:49.167
I’ll give you that one, Brother Bird!

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:55.417
Alright sprites, let’s burn the bodies and have some peppermint tea.
